{"text": "The 2013 Massachusetts drivers manual is an invaluable resource, whether it is time for you to apply for the Mass drivers license or you want to brush up on the state driving rules. Your 2013 MA drivers handbook always contains the most up-to-date information and answers to virtually any driving related question you may have. While the Massachusetts drivers handbook does not have any practice permit test MA questions for you to study, don't worry, as we have plenty of those available on this site and we will get you through your Massachusetts permit test in no time! We advise that every driver always keeps a copy of the 2013 Massachusetts driver's manual in the car for future reference, you never know when it may come in handy!\n'How can I obtain a copy of the Massachusetts drivers manual', 'where can I download a copy of the Massachusetts drivers handbook', 'does the MA RMV charge for the MA permit book?' These are the questions that appear on the site oh so often.\nYou will need to have Adobe Reader or any other program that can open pfd files installed on your computer to be able to open those files. If you don't know what this mambo-jumbo means, give us a buzz, we'll walk you through installing and running it, it only takes a few minutes.\nThis is probably what most of us have used the drivers handbook for - to prepare for the Massachusetts permit test. No doubt, the handbook is the best MA permit test study guide there is: it covers all of the driving rules, road signs, defensive driving tactics and your knowledge exam is based on the information that appears in the book. The only cons of the permit book is the fact that it does not have any permit practice test MA questions for you to study before you take the real exam. Sure, you will be presented with some sample permit questions just before you take the real permit test at the RMV, but if you want to study before you go into the office, you can simply use this MA RMV permit practice test or these free drivers permit practice test MA questions that can be taken over and over again until you learn virtually every rule there is.\nWhile the book is being used primarily by those who are applying for the Massachusetts learners permit, this is not the only use for the book we can think of. In fact, we advise that everyone who holds a Massachusetts drivers license keeps a current copy of the RMV handbook in the car - it is always good to have it nearby when you want to check out some driving rule or make sure you are doing everything right if you or someone else had a traffic accident. So don't throw the book away right after taking your Massachusetts driving test, keep it in the car with you!\nThe Massachusetts drivers manual will be especially useful for teen drivers since it lists all MA learners permit restrictions that need to be observed as part of the Mass graduated drivers license program. The book also explains all requirements to MA drivers education classes, make sure to check them out too!\nMassachusetts drivers handbook. Regular study guide that will suit everyone applying for a regular drivers license.\nMassachusetts commercial drivers manual. Needed for those who are thinking of obtaining a commercial drivers license in Massachusetts.\nMA motorcycle drivers manual. Good for everyone who wants to saddle a motorcycle.\nEven if you are applying for a motorcycle drivers license, it is still a good idea to go through the regular MA drivers handbook first, since it's the most complete and thorough overview of the state driving rules and laws. Once done with the regular drivers manual, pick up the specialized edition that will teach you the specifics of riding a motorcycle or a large commercial vehicle.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T20:19:16Z", "url": "http://www.education4drivers.com/massachusetts/drivers-manual.htm"}

{"text": "Understanding the differences helps teachers provide a positive and encouraging environment for students.\nMale and female brains do not develop in the same way and those differences are most apparent at birth (Cahill, 2006). For boys, the right side of the brain develops early; for girls, the left side of the brain develops first (Shucard & Shucard, 1990). Differential development in the right and left hemispheres continues at least until adolescence (Schmithorst, Holland, & Dardzinski, 2008). The language centre begins in the left por- tion of the cerebral cortex; this developmental difference is cited as the reason that girls, on average, have stronger verbal skills than do boys (Halpern, 2000; Kimura, 2000). The aver- age girl reads better than the average boy and this continues at least into early secondary school (Halpern, 2004).\nMoreover, when learning takes place, the structure of the brain changes (Giedd, 2004; Schmithorst, et al., 2008) as a re- sult of brain plasticity responding to environmental pressures. By adulthood, there are no apparent gender differences in ver- bal intelligence (Halpern, 2000) even though in childhood, girls have significantly larger vocabularies than boys (Morisset, Bar-nard, & Booth, 1995). The belief is that while girls may have an advantage in verbal skills early on due to their more devel- oped left brain hemisphere, over time boys catch up as their brain matures and the hope is that exposure to verbal girls will expand their vocabularies. The problem is that boys may see their relative verbal shortcomings as permanent and either not try to improve their verbal skills, or decide that verbal skills are not important. Additionally the tests which indicate that the verbal differences have been resolved are designed to be gender neutral.\nThe hippocampus is a brain structure involved in memo- ry, specifically in turning short term memories into long term memories. It has been noted that the hippocampus enlarges first in girls (Giedd, Castellanos, Rajapakse, Vaituzis, & Rapo- port, 1997; Yurgelun-Todd, Killgore, & Cintron, 2003). Further, imaging research reveals that when asked to remember something, males tended to use the right side of the hippocam- pus with visual strategies, while females tended to use the left side of that same structure with verbal strategies (Frings et al.,2006). This observation may provide some explanation for the finding that females are better at verbal and episodic memory, based on some form of verbal recall, whereas males are bet- ter at memory tasks involving spatial or directional memory (Andreano & Cahill, 2009).\nThe amygdala has been linked to the excitatory portions of human behaviour (Gur, Gunning-Dixon, Bilker, & Gur, 2002) as well as processing and recognizing emotions. This node enlarges first in boys (Giedd, et al., 1997; Yurgelun-Todd, et al., 2003) and gender differences in structure are found at all ages (Gur, et al., 2002; Whittle et al., 2008). It is thought that the enlarged amygdala may be the basis for the observation that boys do better when they like the subject or the teacher (Freudenthaler, Spinath, & Neubauer, 2008).\nThe prefrontal lobes of the brain begin to mature first in girls and the slower development in boys may be a contributor to the impulsive behaviour which is a hallmark of young males (Baron-Cohen, 2003; Giedd et al., 1999). In females, this portion will have completed development by ages 18 to 20, whereas some males may not have completed development of this area until age 25 or perhaps even later (De Bellis et al.,2001; Njemanze, 2007).\nHearing \u2013 A test for hearing in newborns indicate that the ears of girls are more sensitive than the ears of boys, especially for high frequencies (Cassidy & Ditty, 2001). Other research indicates that girls' ears are more sensitive for soft sounds as well (McFadden, 1998). Additionally, little boys are more likely to suffer inner ear infections (Stenstr\u00f6m & Ingvarsson, 1997) which means that while they have an infection, what they hear may be muffled and indistinct. The important factor here is that the young boy with an ear infection may not be able to hear distinctly at the very time when he should be acquiring phonemic awareness. The problem is that understanding of the basic sounds of language is necessary for the beginning of reading skills (Wolf, 2007).\nVision \u2013When we focus on something, whether words on a page or the scene around us, our eyes are constantly moving around, enabling us to focus on different parts of our field of vision. These movements are called saccades and are larger and more rapid in dyslexics and in boys (Bednarek, Tarnowski, & Grabowska, 2006). Probably related to this eye movement is the finding that girls are better than boys at perceptual speed (Kimura, 2000).\nThis is the skill that allows us to locate simi- lar objects in a field of many other objects or determine which figure is different among several Touch \u2013 While girls may have a greater sensitivity to touch than do boys (Velle, 1987), the observation of teachers is that boys learn best when they can physically interact with materials. A study of effective pedagogical approaches in boys' schools indicated that boys learn better when the lesson involves hands- on activities (Reichert & Hawley, 2010).\nTraditionally, the human response to stress has been de- scribed as fight-or-flight. Under the influence of adrenalin, the body pumps blood, oxygen, and sugar to the muscles and brain to allow the individual to respond quickly to a threat. The origi- nal research only used male subjects and all individuals showed the same response. Recently, it has been discovered that many females do not respond in that way and the female response is called tend-and-befriend (Taylor et al., 2000). Under the in- fluence of oxytocin, the female responds by pumping blood into the center of the body and the result is that the individual may find it difficult to move, think, or respond and needs af- filiation from friends to help cope (Turton & Campbell, 2005).\nPraise and discipline of children will evoke the stress re- sponse in them and consequently, teachers need to be aware of the difference in how children react to such situations. Refer- ring to specific behaviors rather than using global terms such as 'good' or 'bad' will enable children to respond constructively.\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is diagnosed in boys with much greater frequency than in girls, reported fre- quently at the rate of 9:1 (Gaub & Carlson, 1997). There is little consensus as to the cause of this disorder as well as for treatment. Lately, the validity of these diagnoses and, in fact of the condition itself, has come into question. It has been suggested that female teachers misunderstand boys' behaviour and use of language identifying normative male behaviour as abnormal (McIntyre & Tong, 1998).\nDyslexia, the inability to understand information when pre- sented verbally, may be related to slower left temporal lobe de- velopment and slower maturation of the brain, both of which are seen in males (Berninger, Nielsen, Abbott, Wijsman, & Raskind, 2008; Wolf, 2007). However, there are many differ- ent forms of dyslexia and neuroscience is discovering many different sites in the brain may be responsible. One concern is that boys may be identified with dyslexia when they are sim- ply later to develop reading skills.\nDyspraxia is identified in boys more often than in girls and is a problem with writing, but is far more complicated and af- fects many areas of learning. Individuals with this disorder have problems with production of coordinated hand movements and find it difficult to translate thoughts into writing (Berninger& Fuller, 1992; Vlachos & Bonoti, 2003). Poor handwriting skills have been found to contribute to language deficits espe- cially spelling and literacy development (Montgomery, 2008).\nDyscalculia is the learning disability with maths, and is found equally in boys and girls. It was once thought to be a problem with spatial skills, but is now thought to be a problem with memory for numbers and with understanding mathematical processes (Shalev, 2004).\n& Myhill, 2004). Additionally, girls believe that they are more likely to succeed in language based classes and in writing (Meece, Glienke, & Burg, 2006). This emphasis on effort together with the tend-and-befriend stress response may be responsible for the academic anxiety which is found more in girls than in boys.\nHow to prepare girls for math and science \u2013 Give scien- tific explanations, praise content not cover, support successes and do not let failures overwhelm them, provide role models.\nBoys, on the other hand, believe that success is due to their ability to focus on a topic as well as their inherent ability in the subject (Flammer & Schmid, 2003). Additionally, boys believe that they are more likely to succeed in mathematics and science than in language based courses (Meece, et al., 2006). Stress for boys will improve their performance as will any situation which will link their emotions to the learning experience. Forexample, boys can have very good memories, but usually for subjects in which they are very interested and invested (Acker- man, Bowen, Beier, & Kanfer, 2001) indicating a connection between memory and emotions. An important motivating fac- tor for boys was whether or not they liked the activity or not (Freudenthaler, et al., 2008) as well as how well they liked the teacher (Koepke & Harkins, 2008; Van de gaer, Pustjens, Van Damme, & De Munter, 2007).\nClassroom strategies for boys: get them writing early us- ing technology , use visual sources of information, train their ears, use curiosity and competitiveness.\nCognitive differences do exist. They may be brain based or as the result of interaction between brain and environment. Understanding the differences helps teachers provide a positive and encouraging environment for students.\nAckerman, P. L., Bowen, K. R., Beier, M. E., & Kanfer, R. (2001).

With all medical science has discovered about hormone replacement therapy, doctors are strong proponents of it, saying that there is nothing like being your best with testosterone therapy in West Palm Beach FL.\nLow testosterone, or Low-T, can be a serious problem for many older adults because it can affect strength, weight maintenance, moods/temperament and libido. Both men and women can suffer the effects of Low-T, although it is more common in men. Estrogen is the primary sex hormone for women; testosterone is the primary sex hormone for men. Both gender's bodies produce both hormones, but women's produce more estrogen and men's produce more testosterone.\nFor men and women the symptoms of low T are similar; lethargy, mood swings, increased effects of menopause and andropause, low sex drive with impaired performance, and weaker muscles.\nThe only way to tell if Low-T is an issue or is causing symptomology is to conduct a blood test and measure the levels directly. If the levels are clinically low, the individual qualifies for testosterone therapy in West Palm Beach FL with a hormone replacement center like Kingsberg Medical.\nIs Testosterone Therapy Only for Men?\nThe term testosterone is often bandied about in reference to men. When men are together in a group there is often some reference to it, especially if they are involved in watching professional sports and getting very excited. It is not exclusive to men, even though the amount produced in men is significantly larger.\nTestosterone works in tandem with the other body hormones, especially growth hormone, and plays a part in hair growth, energy, muscle tone, weight loss, sexual function, stamina, mental stability and the production of red blood cells. Testosterone therapy in West Palm Beach FL is only an option for those who are viably deficient.\nIf hormone levels are not low, no medication will be prescribed, and it cannot be prescribed to professional athletes for performance enhancement.\nFor men, the most common form of testosterone therapy in West Palm Beach FL is testosterone cypionate injections. The medication can be compounded by our pharmacy if a specific dosage is needed or prescribed under the brand name Depo. This is by far the most effective treatment for most of our patients.\nIn the event of a patient with a much greater need for Low T treatment, our doctors might prescribe the hormone in propionate or enanthate forms. The main difference between these formulations is the frequency of dosage. Since they are administered intramuscularly, the hormone disperses in the body over a period of time. It takes about 7 days for cypionate to completely absorb into the body. The other forms absorb more quickly and must be taken more often.\nA woman in need of supplementing this hormone would most likely be prescribed a cream or gel to control a smaller dose because her prescription would be significantly smaller in dosage. It is a very rare occurrence for a woman to be giving injections, but it is not unheard of.\nSome people get a little nervous at the idea of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) given the scare back in 2002 with problems with hormone replacement therapy using synthetic estrogen. That particular hormone medicine is no longer available, but it still sticks out in people's memory, making them hesitant toward the idea of testosterone therapy in West Palm Beach FL.\nTimes have changed, and so has the way of processing medicine. Testosterone cypionate is a bio-identical medicine. This means, as an exact duplicate of natural hormone, it will not be harmful to the body like the previously created synthetic drugs were.\nAn added safety precaution in therapy to treat Low-T is individual dosing and physician supervision. An over abundance of testosterone is more dangerous than a deficiency, so doctors are very precise in their dosages, and they watch their patients closely during treatment. If any issue arise, they can be nipped in the bud.\nKingsberg Medical provides top-notch testosterone therapy in West Palm Beach FL for adult men and women over the age of 40. The use of this medication is banned from the world of professional sports and cannot be given without a prescription that validates a hormone deficiency. Our facility follows these legal protocols knowing the risks improper use will cause.\nIs Testosterone Therapy an Option for Women?\nWomen's bodies do need testosterone, just not as much as men's bodies need it. During menopause, this hormone can sometimes be even more helpful than estrogen therapy because side effects of estrogen supplementation have been proven to be more severe.\nA woman who may need testosterone therapy in West Palm Beach FL needs to be blood-tested by a physician first. Balancing levels in a woman is a much more precise endeavor than balancing it for a man because, with the minute amounts a woman needs, there is less margin for error, and the side effects of administering too much would be more severe.\nIrregular menstrual periods, increased body hair, a deepening of the voice, and frontal balding. These are things that could happen to a woman with improper dosage. A woman with too much testosterone has a higher risk for infertility. There should be an awareness that some of these side effects are irreversible.\nKingsberg Medical offers testosterone therapy in West Palm Beach FL for women who need it. Call to schedule an appointment for a blood test today.\nTestosterone therapy has proven to be a worthy replacement for estrogen therapy.

{"text": "Rough Night Movie Review - Stealing Genre Title Doesn't Guarantee Success - Are You Screening?\nRough Night is a title that, though semi-meaningless, lets you know where you are to a degree that's somewhat problematic. It doesn't actually tell you anything about this specific movie as much as it just lets you know where to find it.\nWhile the film has several funny moments to keep you moving along with it, it's hard to describe any portion of the plot development without focusing how commonplace and/or 'in typical fashion,' that development is. That's a surprising note in a film about five women who get together for a bachelorette weekend and end up killing a stripper, and one that makes it difficult to get lost in the comedy.\nJess (Scarlett Johansson) and Alice (Jillian Bell) are the main focus of the story and have been best friends, along with Blair (Zo\u00eb Kravitz) and Frankie (Ilana Glazer), since college. Jess is the attractive young woman who befriends her somewhat overweight roommate, and you already know everything you're going to about their relationship. If you sat down for five minutes looking to knock something out based on that information alone, you'd probably come up with the same ideas of Alice being extremely clingy towards Jess. Alice is desperate not to lose their connection, no matter how far in the rear-view college is, and Jess is starting to avoid Alice when possible because Alice tries to dominate her attention whenever she gets the chance.\nBlair and Frankie dated in college, but in the ten years since, Blair has gotten married but is now separated, and you know how that's going to play out.\nAs we prepare for Jess' bachelorette party, which Alice is overplanning, Jess is running for office, Alice is a teacher, Blair is some sort of very wealthy, and Frankie is, apparently, a professional activist. When the party gets together, Pippa (Kate McKinnon), one of Jess' long-time friends from outside the group, shows up to add some much needed comic effect to the crew, and strain Jess and Alice's relationship.\nIt isn't long before the action really heats up, and the vacation home donated for the weekend by one of Jess' donors becomes a crime scene. Now the women have to navigate the obvious problems of causing a death while unwilling to call the police because they've been doing a lot of drugs. Every decision leads to more problems, makes it harder for them to ever get out of the night unscathed, and opens the door for more hilarity to ensue\u2026 more or less. As if things couldn't get bad enough, and because we had a couple of gags written on napkins that we weren't sure how to include, Jess' fiance, Peter (Paul W. Downs), becomes worried when a phone call is cut off and decides to drive his way hundreds of miles to the rescue.\nThe movie reminds of Amy Schumer's Trainwreck, which is decent enough, but shows off the fact that comic abilities don't instantly translate to all mediums. Rough Night is directed and co-written by Broad City\u2018s Lucia Aniello, and co-written by Paul W. Downs, also of Broad City, and the comedy is certainly there. It's mostly fun, will have you laughing, and avoids the stupidity of the later The Hangover movies in favor of the excusably goofy stylings of 'Rough Night' genre entrants like Sisters. What it lacks is a legitimate excuse to keep going for 100 minutes. It includes several gags that are perhaps a lot funnier when tossing things around a writer's room than they manage on camera, but make it to the final cut anyway because we've got time to eat. Our oversexed neighbors Lea (Demi Moore) and Pietro (Ty Burrell) are around as just one example. Socially inappropriate goofs next door are straight out of the comedy Mad Libs, but they don't ultimately deliver much and aren't the right kind of uncomfortable.\nFor every serious laugh in the film, there are 10-15 minutes of muddling through the build, and that comes amid a constant reworking of just how screwy things are going to get. It goes a little too straight, and for too long, to have dead bodies flying out of cars, and too 'stoned slapstick' for the relationship themes to have any weight.\nThe good news is that it's ultimately worth the time if you're just looking to have a few laughs, and Lucia Aniello and Paul W. Downs have the talent to eventually bring things home. There is little that actually brings this down, just not enough bringing it up, and though this one may not become your new favorite, it could easily be in their future.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T14:22:54Z", "url": "http://areyouscreening.com/2017/06/19/movies/rough-night-movie-review-stealing-genre-title-doesnt-guarantee-success/"}
{"text": "The FY 2016 budget the White House will present to Congress, however, shows that President Obama is miles away from reality. Though all the details of the proposal aren't yet public, Bloomberg News has discovered that President Obama will ask Congress for a huge spending increase, one that would blow through discretionary spending caps mandated by the Budget Control Act.\n\"The new spending would mean as much as $34 billion each for the national security and domestic sides of what will be a budget of almost $4 trillion. It will be detailed in the budget proposal Obama will send to Congress on Feb. 2,\" Bloomberg News reports. \"That amounts to an almost 7 percent increase over discretionary spending levels prescribed by automatic cuts known as sequestration voted into law in 2011, according to the people, who asked for anonymity because the budget plan hasn't been released.\"\nThis new spending would bring the discretionary side of the budget, which excludes entitlements and debt service, to $1.08 trillion, up from the $1.015 trillion spending cap mandated by the Budget Control Act. The report notes that \"[i]t's not yet clear whether Obama will seek to offset the spending increases with revenue,\" but given President Obama's proclivity for scoffing at spending cuts and proposing growth-stunting tax hikes in his annual budget proposals, one can probably bet on that.\nWhen asked about the report, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest deflected, telling reporters, \"We'll be prepared to talk about the details of that presentation on Monday, Feb. 2 when it's rolled out.\" He did, however, say that President Obama \"has been pretty clear about the fact over the last two weeks that now is exactly the right time for us start making some policy decisions that will invest in middle-class families.\"\nIt's true that budget deficits have dropped off from the record highs, including four consecutive years of $1+ trillion deficits, Americans saw during the recession and in its immediate aftermath. This is a largely a result of divided government, which, historically, has been effective in restraining spending growth. Indeed, gridlock is good. But the national debt has grown at an unprecedented pace since President Obama took office, surpassing $18 trillion last month.\nMoreover, budget deficits are, according to the Congressional Budget Office, set to rise again in the next few years, consuming a larger share of the economy and eventually topping $1 trillion in 2023 and 2024. The picture is even more disturbing in the long-term, with mandatory spending -- entitlement programs and debt service -- set to consume larger shares of the economy and drive up the budget deficit.\nThe time is now to balance the federal budget. It's an achievable goal, as Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) demonstrated in his five-year balanced budget plan, but it will require Republican leaders act proactively rather than reactively. This means that all areas of the budget should be on the table for discussion, including those driven by the crony special interests which have played a part in this generational theft known as the national debt.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T04:56:22Z", "url": "http://www.freedomworks.org/content/barack-obama-will-propose-big-spending-increase-his-next-budget"}

{"text": "The Good Provides access to iTunes-based movie rentals, TV shows, music, photos, and podcasts, as well as YouTube videos on your living room TV; streams media from networked Mac or Windows PCs; purchases and rentals can be done directly through iTunes Store on your TV; movie rentals from all major studios include some in HD and surround sound; sleek external design and elegant user interface; simple, streamlined setup; includes state-of-the-art 802.11n wireless networking; smooth, hiccup-free streaming.\nThe Bad No support for Netflix, Pandora, and other major online media services found on most new Blu-ray players; doesn't work with older, non-widescreen TVs; movie rentals must be watched within 24 hour timeframe; no subscription payment options; lackluster file support for non-iTunes video formats; oversimplified remote can't control other devices.\nThe Bottom Line Apple TV provides a slick venue for iTunes-based media in the living room, but the average Blu-ray player now provides a wider array of online media options.\nEditors' Note (October 1, 2010): This old version of the Apple TV has been replaced with a smaller $99 Apple TV that adds Netflix compatibility.\nEditors' Note (August 16, 2010): We have lowered the rating on this product due to changes in the competitive marketplace. Customers interested in Apple TV should note that there are persistent rumors that this product (now more than three years old) will soon be replaced with an updated model that includes app-based online content services.\nEditors' Note (September 14, 2009): Apple has discontinued the 40GB version of the Apple TV and lowered the price of the 160GB version to $229.\nEditors' Note (February 12, 2008): This review has been updated--and the editors' rating has been raised--to reflect version 2.0 of the Apple TV firmware. Note, however, that user opinions entered prior to February 12, 2008 reflect users' experience with earlier versions of the Apple TV firmware and iTunes Store.\nWhen the Apple TV was first released in March 2007, we praised its elegant interface, pain-free setup, and overall ease of use--all of which were a big departure from previous network-based entertainment devices for the home. The problem was that the Apple TV just didn't do a whole lot. Even with a later upgrade that added the ability to access YouTube videos, the product was little more than an \"iTunes extender\" for the living room. And viewed through that prism, it had issues: you could only access iTunes content that had already been downloaded to a networked computer and--because they were optimized for the small screen of an iPod--all of those iTunes-purchased TV shows and movies looked pretty bad on a big-screen TV.\nAlmost a year later, the hardware remains exactly the same, but a free software upgrade--and some changes to the iTunes Store--effectively gives the product a makeover. Apple TV now delivers direct access to the iTunes Store, so you no longer need to run over to your computer to pick the TV shows and movies you'd like to watch. Movie rentals from all major Hollywood studios are now available, and the quality of the iTunes video offerings has been significantly improved, with movies and TV shows in improved standard-definition and--for some movie rentals--720p HD video and 5.1 Dolby surround sound. And--if you've got decent broadband bandwidth--the videos start streaming from the Web within seconds (with a slightly longer delay for HD flicks). The software update also adds access to online photo galleries from Flickr and .Mac accounts. And all of that new functionality comes in addition to the Apple TV's old bag of tricks: the ability to access a full range of online podcasts and YouTube videos as well as the bulk of the digital photos and iTunes music and video library already sitting on any of the PCs and Macs on your home network. To top it off, Apple has cut the price: the 40GB model is now $229, while the 160GB version is $329. Yes, we still have a wish list a mile long for additional functionality and features we'd like to see in the Apple TV, but the updated version transforms the device into a bona-fide video-on-demand box with a lot more potential than the original version.\nMovies: Any movie available from the iTunes Store can be viewed on Apple TV. Movies are available only for rent: $2.99 for older titles, $3.99 for new releases, and a buck more each for the HD versions. Some of the high-def versions also offer full Dolby Digital 5.1 surround soundtracks. Apple has secured contracts with all the major movie studios, and the company is pledging to have 1,000 movie rentals available by the end of February 2008, with as many as a tenth of them having HD versions available. Rentals come with expiration dates, however: they must be viewed within 30 days of download and there's a 24-hour time limit once viewing begins.\nTV shows: TV shows can be purchased from the iTunes Store for $1.99 an episode, or a whole season for a bulk price. Most current TV shows can be purchased, though NBC/Universal shows are a notable holdout at the time of this writing. Shows are not yet available in HD, but the bitrate on the standard-definition video quality has been revved up, so they now look better on big-screen TVs.\nOther iTunes videos: Unlike many digital media adapters, the Apple TV can't stream many common video file formats--including DivX, Xvid, AVI, WMV, and MPEG--directly from the hard drive. These files must first be manually converted and imported into the iTunes software. (There are a variety of ways to convert third-party videos, but ones that users have already optimized for the iPod or iPhone will note that the video quality will suffer when it's blown up for the big screen.) In addition to imported videos, the Apple TV can also stream computer-based videos that have been purchased or rented from the iTunes Store.\nYouTube: Over the past several months, YouTube has been converting the bulk of its video content to h.264 versions that are optimized for the iPhone and Apple TV. The videos are directly accessible through the Apple TV's main menu, under sensible submenus such as \"featured,\" \"most viewed,\" \"top rated,\" and the like. You can also log in to your YouTube accounts and access your favorites.\nMusic: The Apple TV can be used to buy music directly through the iTunes Store and to stream songs already in the library on your networked computer. (Audiobooks can't be purchased through the on-screen interface, but they can be streamed from networked computers to the Apple TV.) Annoyingly, despite being available on the iTunes desktop software, Internet radio stations are not accessible on the Apple TV.\nPhotos: Apple TV will automatically pull in any photos already in iPhoto (Macs) or PhotoShop Elements (Windows). Alternately, you can have the Apple TV pull photos from any folder (such as the \"My Pictures\" folder) on a networked computer. New to the 2008 update is the ability to access photos on the Flickr and .Mac online services--just type in the username, and you'll have access to his or her gallery (assuming it's been made public). Photos can be viewed as slide shows, complete with transition effects and the iTunes playlist of your choice as background music.\nPodcasts: The same library of podcasts available via the iTunes Store is accessible on the Apple TV. As with the video and music stores, either choose from the most popular choices on the main splash screen, or search for your favorites via the onscreen keyboard. Audio and video podcasts are available--some \"HD\" podcasts are even optimized for the Apple TV.\nAirTunes remote speaker: The Apple TV can be used as a remote speaker for any connected iTunes software. Just click the menu in the lower-right corner of the iTunes window and choose \"Apple TV.\" Doing so will \"hijack\" the Apple TV into playing whatever audio you've got up and running on iTunes, including Internet radio. It's a useful feature if you want to stream music to your living room stereo without having the TV turned on.\nThe Apple TV itself is a tiny, silver square with rounded corners measuring 7.7 inches per side and just 1.1 inches high. That's far smaller than most standard DVD players and stereo equipment; like the similarly sized Mac Mini or Nintendo Wii, the Apple TV will fit just about anywhere. It also sports a minimalist aesthetic that's classic Apple--the front panel has only a power light and the remote sensor. There are absolutely no buttons, nor is there a front-panel display. As mentioned, it's available in two capacities: 40GB and, for $100 more, 160GB (though about 7GB on each model is dedicated to system software, and is thus off limits to the user).\nThe Apple TV is much smaller than a standard DVD player.\nOnce you plug it in, it's always on. There's no cooling fan, which makes for essentially silent operation, an important feature in a home theater device. The box does get at least as hot as your average laptop, however, so be sure to give it plenty of ventilation.\nThe included remote will be familiar to Apple aficionados. It's the exact same gumstick-size clicker that ships with recent iMac models, featuring the same five-way navigation pad found on an iPod Shuffle (play/pause, back/forward, and the plus/minus buttons), plus a \"menu\" button that doubles as \"back\" when navigating the Apple TV menus. Unfortunately, the little remote can't be programmed to control the volume of your TV or AV receiver. Because it's a standard infrared remote, you can program a universal remote to control the Apple TV.\nThe Apple TV remote is the same one that ships with iMacs.\nApple's package includes the remote, the power cord, the instruction manual, and the unit itself. It's up to you to supply any AV or HDMI cables.\nThe Apple TV has a decent set of network and AV jacks crammed onto its backside, but it's by no means comprehensive. There are two video output options: component (red, green, blue) and HDMI. If you connect to a TV or an AV receiver via HDMI, that single cable will handle video and audio. Otherwise, audio can be output via analog stereo (red and white RCA jacks) or optical digital. The dearth of composite and S-Video connectors means that the Apple TV is not just HD friendly, it's pretty much HD only. (Technically it will work with 480i standard-definition TVs that have a component video input, but the image on monitors that are not wide-screen will be stretched). While we're all in favor of future-proofing, a little backward compatibility would've been nice, too.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T07:59:14Z", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/reviews/apple-tv-2007-review/"}

{"text": "Specialty chemicals manufacturer Lanxess has been unable to get the mix right in 2013, but it should rediscover its winning formula in the next 12 months.\nThe German company has endured a difficult start to the year, with notably weak demand in polymers, lower prices in general-purpose products, customers destocking in most markets, and scheduled one-off costs. But its prospects for the second half and beyond are much brighter.\nIts shares (ticker: LXS.Germany), which fizzed 60% higher in 2012, have dropped more than 13% since Jan. 1, sharply underperforming a 10% rise in Frankfurt's benchmark DAX index. Lanxess closed Friday at 57.15 euros ($74.12), in the middle of their 52-week trading range of \u20ac45.74 to \u20ac69.99. The stock, which offers a 1.7% dividend yield, is cheap, compared with rivals', trading at just 9.5 times forecast 2014 earnings versus 11.9 times for BASF (BAS.Germany) and 13 times for Akzo Nobel (AKZA.Netherlands).\nLANXESS, WHICH HAS A STOCK-market value of \u20ac4.75 billion, can climb as high as \u20ac70\u2014more than 20% above the current price\u2014in 12 months, some analysts say. It could be worth even more, especially if it gets picked off in a round of consolidation by an ambitious player like Saudi Basic Industries (2010.Saudi Arabia). There's no suggestion that a predator is circling, however.\nLanxess develops and produces plastics, rubbers, and specialty chemicals. It is targeting megatrends in mobility, urbanization, water, and agriculture. Spun off from Bayer (BAYN.Germany) nine years ago, it's a leading supplier of synthetic rubbers used in car and truck tires. It is well placed to benefit from growing demand for high-performance rubber products and high-tech plastics for tires that sharply reduce fuel consumption and, thus, emissions, helping auto makers meet tougher environmental standards.\nIts performance polymers unit, which includes rubber products, accounted for 57% of the company's \u20ac9.09 billion in 2012 revenue. Sales this year are expected to dip to \u20ac8.69 billion, as Lanxess' robust performances in Asia and in agrochemicals are checked by delayed tire replacement in developed markets, owing to sluggish economies, and the cost of setting up a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Singapore.\nLanxess is expanding heavily in Asia, where it aims to cash in on the rising demand for cars from an increasingly wealthy population. Capital expenditures peaked in 2012, and, to offset weaker demand and lower prices, Lanxess has trimmed its budget this year to \u20ac600 million from the \u20ac650 million to \u20ac700 million originally planned.\nA slowdown in automotive markets in Europe, North America, and Latin America also has prompted Lanxess to idle a couple of plants as it tries to maintain a price-before-volume strategy, but this has squeezed working capital and weighed on profits.\nDespite the measures that management has taken, performance in 2013 will fall short of last year's. Lanxess is expected to earn \u20ac3.34 per share this year, down from \u20ac6.53 in 2012. It will get back on track in 2014, when its major markets begin to rebound and capex falls further. The company is forecast to earn \u20ac6.01 a share next year, according to the consensus analysts' estimates compiled by FactSet.\nInvestors don't fully appreciate Lanxess' dominant position in supplying the tire industry with high-performance rubbers needed to produce more environmentally friendly products, says Alex Roepers, a value and activist investor who runs Atlantic Investment Management in New York. Roepers, who owns the stock, maintains that, with the new Singapore plant in place next year and tire-replacement demand normalizing, stronger earnings will resume in 2014. But he adds: \"People are just not willing to buy ahead\" of that. He reckons the stock could climb to \u20ac85 to \u20ac90 in a year.\nINDUSTRIAL CONGLOMERATE Smiths Group confirmed Friday that it had received a preliminary offer for its medical division, raising yet again the possibility of the breakup of the United Kingdom-based company.\nBut a deal looks unlikely and, after a 37% runup in the past year, there seems to be little upside in the stock's American depositary receipts (SMGZY), which were changing hands at midday Friday at $21.17. The indicative bid for the medical unit, reportedly two billion British pounds ($3.04 billion), is less than an offer Smiths got a couple of years ago.\nThe medical business, a cash generator with high margins, accounts for 28% of Smiths' sales, but 34% of operating profit. Smiths has shown already that it won't sell the unit on the cheap. So, speculation on what the company might do with the proceeds from a sale seems quite premature.\nItalian stocks rose 1.9% and Swiss equities fell 2.7% on the week.", "timestamp": "2019-04-24T05:47:44Z", "url": "https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424052748704895304578503483486641670"}

Speaking of hair, how freaking hot is Jimin with red hair?!! He is the definition of H.O.T! I hate doctors but Jin is making me question myself a little on that. Taehyung is always so adorable no matter what he's doing and finally J-hope\u2026.I have no words right now. I needed to just say all that and get it out my system, moving on (ha-ha).\nI can't recall how many times I kept clicking the replay button on this MV since it came out. This song is one of my favorite on the album besides I NEED YOU. For me personally, the dance was the best part of the video\u2026I'm not saying that the whole video was crappy and that the dance saved it. The video was actually good and our boys did their best with what they had. I really like the whole occupation concept and it's nice seeing the boys having fun with it. The lyrics were very meaningful and lets not forget the saxophone in the background!!! I swear I have this crazeee thing for instruments.\nWith the third mini album, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life/Mood For Love pt.1, the boys have definitely caught the attention of many people across the globe. I love that this concept shows that the \u2018boys' are now MEN.\nIf you haven't listen to the album as yet, please check it out. All the tracks are really good, plus this time all the members took part in the songwriting. Awesomeness!!\nI can't stop listening to this song. It's sad that Joon and Thunder is no longer apart of MBLAQ but we fans of course still support our boys.\nMir\u2018s rap as always was flawless, G.O\u2018s high notes never fail and we got to hear more of Seungho\u2018s voice which sounds so darn good.\nI wish these boys the best of luck in their future activities and I hope soon they'll be able to talk with each other again.\nBIG BANG's Taeyang and actress Min Hyo Rin dating!!!\nResurfaced dating rumors of Taeyang and Min Hyo Rin has been confirm by both YG Entertainment and JYP Entertainment to be true. According to several sources, the two stars met through the filming for Taeyang's \uc0c8\ubcbd\ud55c\uc2dc(1AM) Music Video in September of 2013 and have been dating for two years.\nThis was totally unexpected but I have to say I'm really happy about it. Finally our Taeyang be dating!! Now your fans don't have to worry about you being single forever, \uc624\ube60 (he-he) But who would have thought our Taeyang would be the first to date publicly among Big Bang? Certainly not me.\nI'm really happy that most of the reaction towards the dating news has been supportive. I also want to say to all those people out there bashing on Min Hyo Rin to grow up and stop behaving like immature bratz. Who are you to decide whether or not she's good for Taeyang? It sickens me to see those few comments about how ugly she is or Taeyang could do better etc. You haters need to get over yourselves.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T07:48:12Z", "url": "https://jovialsworld.wordpress.com/category/korean/"}

{"text": "The costs of Traumatic Brain Injury to the UK as a whole are not as well understood as its immediate consequences, in part due to difficulties in quantifying human emotional cost, and also because of how brain injuries affect some victims more severely than others.\nNonetheless figures from a wider European study commissioned by the European Brain Council and summarised in Olesen et al. (2012) can be extracted to give some basic estimates of financial cost in the UK.\nFocusing on figures collated for a single year (2010) and accounting for both contemporary cases of traumatic brain injury and historical ones with lasting health implications for the victim(s), the study gives an insight into the annual costs of providing health and social care, plus economic output losses as a result of long term disability (but not premature mortality) of victims. When extrapolated from the wider European figure and converted from euros into pounds, the total annual cost was calculated to be in the region of \u00a35.1 billion, allocated to 452,000 cases of traumatic brain injury. Of these cases, 145,000 were deemed 'incident' cases occurring in 2010, with the remaining 307,000 having occurred at some point over the previous 20 years with lasting disability costs qualifying them as 'prevalent' cases. Costs were calculated on the basis on the number of people admitted to hospital for treatment of a traumatic brain injury.\nOn an individual basis, this breaks down to an approximate cost of around \u00a311,340 per year, per case. It was not possible to breakdown exactly how these costs were divided specifically for the UK, however in the broader European context around 31% of the costs related directly to healthcare, with care costs (including informal care) measured at around 10%, and economic output losses at 59%.\nRelying too much on these average figures is reductive however, as the study's authors note. 'Incident' cases are likely to incur a far higher cost allocation in regards to healthcare for an immediate incident than 'prevalent' cases, whose health costs are spread more evenly across a number of years. On the other hand, it's also true that 'prevalent' cases are comprised of more moderate to severe brain injury cases, as these are the ones more likely to incur lasting costs over a period of several years, whilst 'incident' cases include costs for mild injuries that in time may no longer be a source of significant expense.\nDetailed, up-to-date studies from other developed countries are hard to come by, so it's difficult to assess just how the costs of traumatic brain injury in the UK compare, especially if population size inconsistencies are to be taken into account. Nonetheless, estimates from the Centre for Mental Health's economic analysis; released July 2016, indicate that annual costs of traumatic brain injury in relation to national gross domestic product (GDP) stand at around 0.815% for the US, 0.351% for Australia and 0.328% for the UK.\nSome studies however prefer to estimate costs based not on incidence rates recorded in terms of hospital in-patients, but on prevalence rates amongst the general population, which would shift the number of UK cases per year from 452,000 up to around 1.3million. When this approach is adopted, aggregate brain injury costs relative to UK GDP rise to 0.934%, with conservative estimates indicating this would amount to around \u00a315million per year, again with the lion's share allocated to a loss of economic output from victims.\nWhichever approach is taken, incident of traumatic brain injury cost the UK economy billions of pounds every year, and this does not account for losses in terms of quality of life or bereavement to the individuals, families and friends involved, which should surely rank highly in any appraisal of their impact on the nation as a whole.", "timestamp": "2019-04-21T08:15:28Z", "url": "https://blackwaterlaw.co.uk/cost-traumatic-brain-injury-uk/"}
{"text": "The Palm Pre - the possible business savior of Palm, and potentially the iPhone's first real competition - is now available for purchase. The Pre's launch is also a big moment for carrier Sprint, which reportedly believes it is a very different company than it was just a year ago.\nThe long-awaited Palm Pre is officially now available-and will have two whole days to bask in the glow of the world's full attention, before Monday, June 8, arrives and with it the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference.\nThe already popular WWDC, at which Apple is likely to introduce a new iPhone, garnered fresh attention on June 5, when the Financial Times reported that a \"junior\" iPhone, priced between $99 and $149, and not expected to make a WWDC debut, may in fact appear-along with Steve Jobs, announcing a resumption of his former leadership position.\nOn June 6, Reuters reported that enthusiastic crowds had gathered by several Sprint stores in major cities with people willing to shell out cash for the new Palm Pre. The report also noted that the crowds were smaller than those seen when a new Apple iPhone had been announced.\nBut for now, the attention is on the Pre, which is expected to be difficult to get a hold of, with demand exceeding supply.\nA few extra bodies may be filling the lines at registers, after reading reviews this week by The New York Times' David Pogue and the Wall Street Journal's Walter S. Mossberg, who both reviewed it favorably. Pogue called it \"elegant, joyous,\" and Mossberg wrote it was \"thoughtfully designed.\"\nHowever, both men criticized the lack of applications and said Palm will have to very quickly attract third-party developers-which some insist won't be very hard to do, explaining that the Pre's WebOS operating system uses already familiar technologies, which will enable developers to get to work without delay.\nSprint CEO Dan Hesse is also excited for today, calling the Pre launch also \"a coming out party\" for the new-and-improved Sprint, Reuters reported June 5.\nSome critics have expressed doubt about Sprint's ability to help drive the Pre's success. According to Reuters, Hesse told analysts on June 5, \"We're a very different company than we were 12 months ago.\"\nThe success of the Pre and the future of Palm are currently playing out nationwide in Sprint stores, at certain Wal-Mart locations, and at Radio Shack and Best Buy. At the latter, customers don't have to mail in the rebate, but receive it on site, bringing the price to $199 with a two-year service contract.\nA close-up look at the Palm Pre is available here.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T14:49:37Z", "url": "https://www.eweek.com/mobile/palm-pre-in-stores-sprint-gets-a-coming-out-party"}

{"text": "The fear of death or bodily harm can be the most compelling fear of all. The one reality we are sure of is the one we are living in; everything else is by faith. If this life and body are the only hope and reality we know then death can be particularly disturbing and fearful. Life, as we know it will cease to exist; then what darkness, nothing, back to dust?\nSome who read this could be walking through the valley of the shadow of death today. It is built into us to protect and preserve our lives. That fear will motivate us to do everything within our power to avoid death. When we are really brought face to face with our mortality it is a sobering thing. It makes us look deep within ourselves to think about the meaning of life and what the loss of it holds for us. We examine our values and what we truly believe.\nDavid was certainly faced with the awesome possibility of death as King Saul hunted him to take his life. He was often faced with enemies that desired his death. I believe David had learned a principle as a shepherd. He knew that his sheep were totally dependent upon him, as their shepherd, for protection. They had no real ability to protect themselves. They knew that if they staid close to the shepherd, his rod and staff, his authority and power, would protect them. Their greatest peace and our greatest peace are in knowing that we are walking with the Shepherd and that our life is not in our hands, it is in His. We are at peace and we have comfort even in the midst of the certain threat of death because He is there and our life is hid with Christ in God. The faith we have in our Shepherd is able to dispel the grip of fear that is seeking desperately to lay hold of our hearts. Faith will dispel fear, but the lack of it will give place to it. If we walk in the light, then we will not fear the darkness, for even if darkness surrounds us, it can not extinguish the light and the hope we have within us through Christ Jesus. Often it can become a battleground between faith and fear as the fear of death seeks to lay hold of us.\nOne scripture that brings us much encouragement in this fear of death is found in Hebrews 2:14-15. It says, speaking of Jesus, 'Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death\u2014that is, the devil\u2014 15and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.' We have peace and assurance through the blood of Jesus and the confidence that through our trust in Him, He has paid for our sin, and robbed the devil of the fear eternal punishment and condemnation he once could put upon us. Now we have the peace and confidence that when death comes we step out of the limitations of our mortal body into glory and into His wonderful presence. We can almost view death as no longer as a curse, but as a promotion. No wonder so many Christians through the ages have been able to hold fast their testimony and give up their possessions, their livelihood and their very lives. They had their eyes fixed on One far more glorious that quenched the fear of death and loss. It was the One who walked with them through the valley of the shadow of death.\nOne of the greatest fears and terrors is that of the unknown, but the knowledge we have in Christ and the faith that we have placed in that knowledge of Him has robbed satan of his power of fear and intimidation.\nWhen Israel had come out of Egypt and was going up to battle against their enemies, this is the word that was spoken to them and what I believe the Lord wants us to hold fast in our hearts as we enter our battles. It was spoken in Deuteronomy 20:1-4, 'When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours, do not be afraid of them, because the LORD your God, who brought you up out of Egypt, will be with you. 2 When you are about to go into battle, the priest shall come forward and address the army. 3 He shall say: 'Hear, O Israel, today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not be terrified or give way to panic before them. 4 For the LORD your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.'' If we know that we are already victorious in Christ what have we to fear? The worst that could happen is that we would wake up in His arms. In Psalms 27:1 David says, 'The LORD [is] my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD [is] the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?' It is like when you were a small child and something frightened you. You could run and jump up on daddy's lap, bury your face in his chest and he would put his powerful arms around you. You knew then that you were safe; that anything that touched you now had to come through your daddy first. That is exactly how it is for us in the Lord. Colossians 3:1-4 tells us, 'Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. 2Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. 3For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. 4When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.' If we are truly dead to the things and the affections of this world then what power of fear does the devil have over us seeing that we have died and our life is now hidden with Christ in God? If the devil touches us, he has to come through God to do it. If I know that God has control over all that touches my life then I have no room for fear, only for trust. He is my good Shepherd that will lead me and keep me wherever I must go and through whatever valley of the shadow of death I must pass, I will fear no evil.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T12:39:50Z", "url": "https://tricklesoftruth.wordpress.com/2016/02/08/the-fear-of-death/?shared=email&msg=fail"}
{"text": "University/college is the most exciting time in one's life. There's nothing more exhilarating for a young adult than moving away from home and leading an independent lifestyle. University is character building. In the same sentiment however University is life developing.\nEnrolling on a University/College course is also the biggest decision you will make in your life to date and a decision which many choose the wrong path. I've seen friends enrol at University on any course they can manage just to \u2018experience' it. I've seen others take on specific, technical degrees, stumble through the course and then struggle to land the chosen role after finishing their studies.\nThere's no right and wrong course to study. There is however strategic choices you can make which will contribute towards your life in the future. Degrees have always had an importance but choosing the right degree is becoming more important by the day given the Global economic climate conditions.\nI speak from experience in choosing a degree which matched the future of business. It wasn't a coincidence; it wasn't a stroke of luck. I was aware of where business was moving and chose a degree which could make possible my future goals and aspirations.\nHere are five steps which can help make your studies worthwhile and enable them to be a contributor in your long term career success.\nThis may be self explanatory but the type of degree you choose needs to be transferable to the real world of work. Many universities offer a qualification in \u2018Art History' which is a degree of style over substance. There's obviously limited vacancies in the Gallery Curator field. Having a degree in IT for example would be transferable to a high number of internships and junior roles in the IT sector upon leaving University.\nYour degree needs to have something of value to you once you leave University. It's an asset, not just a piece of paper or a 3 year experience.\nYou are 17 years old when you have to start making decisions on which degree you will take at University. It's fair to assume you would need some help on this. Studying business trends, predictions for the next 3-5 years gives a strong indication as to whether your degree will still be valid by the time you graduate.\nWhen I went to University I was already passionate about the Web and could see the avenue in which business was becoming stronger online. I knew a web based degree would give me a solid background when it came to graduation.\nOn the other hand however I had friends who chose a vanity degree and a vanity career. Many chose offline journalism, others chose psychology; both extremely competitive industries. Assessing where business is going, the future and how your degree falls into this is essential when enrolling on a course.\nSeek advice on the future of business/industry.\nI always knew I would work on the web. I was creating websites at the age of 14 and it was always a dream of mine to continue this as a career. I essentially knew my end goal. Although I now work predominantly in online marketing I had pinpointed a desired job role within the web sector meaning I enrolled on the right course in the beginning.\nEveryone should harbor ambition and having a clear path to what you are looking to achieve will help you achieve the end goal you desire. You may stray slightly but by having a degree which covers a specific area in general you have room to move around within the industry.\nHow many parents help you choose which degree you should enroll on?\u2026Many. How many parents actually know what their son/daughter is passionate about? Very few. When I say choose a degree you are passionate about it has to be something which still matches the other points throughout this post. I always had a passion for the web. I didn't always have a passion for search engines and how they work.\nI have a friend who runs an extremely successful fashion blog. She chose to do an English degree as writing was another passion of hers. The key is to focus on a passion and then make sure it fits within the boundaries of a long term career.\nMy partner was always fantastic around child; she chose a degree in teaching. The passion has to be transferable but if you can find something you have a strong chance of a long, fruitful career.\nThe Degree course needs to be flexible across a number of job roles.\nMy degree was a generic web course which focused on design, marketing and analysis. It was painfully generic and lacked any depth however that flexibility enabled me to land my first junior role before completing the course.\nHaving a web background meant I was able to apply for any role which fell under the web umbrella. Furthermore I had \u2018enough' knowledge in each area to have a well rounded CV which most companies look for in a graduate. My initial ambitions were a career in web design however the flexibility of my degree allowed me to apply for a role within the marketing area of the web.\nPoor examples of flexibility are studying a retail management degree. Given the precarious nature of the retail industry you are limiting yourself within a specific sector, a sector of which is currently on the downturn. Choosing a more rounded, closely related degree like business management would have allowed the graduate more flexibility in moving into less unstable sectors.\nHow successful was your degree?\nFrom speaking with friends how worthwhile University was is largely split 50/50. How success was your degree in helping you gain the job you have today? How did your degree set you up for your life ahead? Was it merely the \u2018piece of paper' or the \u2018qualification' to get your foot in the door? Tell us your positives and negative of University academic life.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T00:19:06Z", "url": "http://www.generationy.com/how-to-choose-a-career/"}

{"text": "Three-gun shooting is the fastest growing competitive shooting sport in the nation. As the name suggests, competitors use three guns; pistol, shotgun and rifle. Of the three, the rifle is called on for the widest range of use. A shooter might engage multiple close range targets very fast, and within seconds transition to precision targets at long range. I have shot at rifle targets from as close as 18 inches to as far away as 800 yards in a single match. The key is to do it with speed and precision, as the guy who hits all the targets the fastest wins the match.\nFor a long time competitors had to spend time and money to modify their rifles to make them suitable for competition. But rifle makers have noticed the growth in the sport and several are now offering 'competition ready' rifles in their catalogs. Here are three that I have been lucky enough to test.\nColt Competition was started with the concept that 3-gun competitors needed rifles that were ready to shoot. The Pro model is the higher grade of the two Colt Competition .223 Remington rifles offered. It was designed by hardcore shooters and tested extensively at national 3-gun matches.\nIt has an 18-inch long, match-grade stainless steel barrel. The custom fluting on the barrel is unique and exotic looking with a series of interrupted flutes. The barrel is six-groove button rifled with a 1:8 RH Twist. The 1:8 twist is preferred by most 3-gun shooters as it will stabilize heavy bullets but also handle light bullets, so it provides the widest range of ammo options for shooters.\nThe gun has a .223 Wylde Match Chamber and uses a rifle-length gas system. This longer system is more reliable and smoother than a short 'carbine' length gas system. It has the Colt Competition Fully-Adjustable Gas Block, which allows the shooter to tune the rifle to the specific ammo used. The result is a smoother action cycle, which can aid in speed and accuracy. The smoother the gun runs, the less disturbance on target and the faster the next shot can be taken. Those tenths of a second in split times add up in a game that's won or lost by seconds.\nMine is an early rifle and came with a Sure-Fire muzzle brake. This is a very effective brake that's also designed to attach a suppressor. The current rifles are being shipped with the new Colt Competition Triple-Chamber Muzzle Brake while the Sure-Fire is still offered as an option.\nThe Colt Competition uses a proprietary 15-inch floating handguard, which is the perfect length for the extended arm grip favored by a lot of shooters.\nThe upper and lower receivers are forged and machined for a precision fit. The upper is a flat-top with a Picatinny rail on top. The lower has the Colt Competition logo laser engraved into the side of the magwell.\nThe rifle has a proofed and magnetic particle (MP) inspected bolt. The charging handle has an extended latch for fast operation. Meanwhile, the two-stage trigger on my gun breaks at 2 pounds, 12 ounces; lighter than the advertised 3.5-pound trigger and great for precision long-range shooting. It has a short and positive reset for fast work.\nThe gun has a Magpul CTR 6-Position Adjustable Stock, Magpul arched Trigger Guard and a Magpul Grip. As you might guess, it comes with a Magpul 30-round magazine. The safety is a standard, two position AR-15 safety.\nThe rifle is extremely accurate and with the light trigger it's easy to use for precision long-range work. The average for 12, five-shot groups at 100 yards with three different ammo products was just .9-inch. The best groups were .65-inch for five shots.\nWhen shooting speed drills to test my time, my best effort with this rifle was 1.6 seconds, which is the second best I have ever done.\nThis is a gun that you can take out of the box, add optics and ammo and win matches. I know that to be true, not just hype; because I have several shooting buddies who have done it.\nI am in the middle of the third shooting season using the JP15 rifle for competition. It's not very objective for a gun writer to say there is magic in a rifle, but in this one there is.\nLet me tell you a couple of reasons why I think this way. We have a speed drill we practice often (mentioned earlier in this article): three targets at 5 yards and spaced three feet apart. The shooter starts with the gun on his shoulder and the barrel pointing at the ground. At the buzzer he fires two shots at each target. My best time is 1.3 seconds with the JP. I do this drill with every rifle I get in here to test, which is a lot of guns. I have never been able to beat that time.\nDuring the 2012 Iron Man 3-Gun Match I engaged three sets of bonus targets at 550, 650 and 799 yards. The shooter was allowed up to five hits on each target. Most competitors brought a long range precision rifle for this stage, but I used the JP and cleaned all 15 bonus targets. I think I am the only competitor to do that with a main-match, competition .223 rifle.\nThis rifle is extremely accurate and 100 percent dependable; both are qualities needed to help a shooter step up to the winner's table. I am not anal enough to keep actual records of each round fired in every rifle I have, but I am well north of 15,000 rounds through this rifle without a gun-related hitch. When shooting ammo it likes, it still shoots half-MOA.\nThe JP15 is the 'entry level' rifle from JP Enterprises. But that's like saying an 'entry level' Ferrari, because the JP entry level picks up where a lot of other gun makers end off.\nThe heart of the system, as it is with any accurate rifle, is the barrel, which in this rifle is the JP Supermatch barrel. This button-rifled barrel is made from 416R stainless steel. This is a pre-hardened chromium stainless steel, which is engineered for use in precision match-grade rifle barrels and designed to work well with button rifling.\nThe barrel has a 1:8 twist rate and is air-gauged and cryogenically treated. It measures .88-inch at the muzzle where it meets the brake. The barrel has a wasp-waist that is fitted with a set of cooling fins hidden under the handguard to aid in rapid heat dissipation. The JP Thermal Dissipater between the gas block and receiver results in a 700 percent increase in surface area under the handguard. This keeps the accuracy-robbing heat from building up during sustained fire drills. That keeps the shooter's hand cooler, but more importantly it enhances barrel life, too.\nThe chamber is .223 Wylde that will accept .223 Remington, as well as 5.56x45mm ammo. The barrel is fitted with a JP Compensator that is timed and blended to the barrel so well you can't see the panty line.\nMy rifle has the JP Low Mass Operating System. This system uses a reduced weight bolt carrier and low mass buffer with a matched buffer spring. This speeds up the cycle rate and makes the rifle run smoother, which is an asset when doing rapid, aimed fire, particularly during some of the drills common to many 3-gun matches.\nThe rifle has the JP single-stage Fire Control trigger system with the low mass speed hammer for a faster lock time.\nThe receivers are 7075 mil-spec forged. The long, round, vented JP Modular Hand Guard is well suited for competition. It has a rail on top and two swivels. The side swivel is for a sling while the bottom is used for a bi-pod. The buttstock is the ACE ARFX skeletal, which I find perfect for 3-gun competition. There are a lot of reasons why I am not the top Tactical Optics class shooter in the country, but I guarantee my rifle is not one of them!\nTrigger: JP Fire Control Package available in weights of 3.0 \u2013 4.5 lbs.\nStag Arms is well known for producing left handed AR-15 style rifles, as well as the conventional right handed models. They got noticed for the southpaw aspect, but built their name by producing high quality rifles. The 3G is their competition ready rifle and can be ordered in a right or left hand model. I have a couple of southpaw shooting buddies who are very happy about that.\nStag Arms worked with their 3-gun shooting team to develop the new rifle. There are in truth a few things I would change. For example, I would add an extended charging handle latch, a tactical bolt release and possibly an ambi-safety. But these are small things and the truth is, this gun is competition ready out of the box. The one major change is I would also use a different muzzle brake as the one in my rifle over-compensates and drives the muzzle too low. All in all, minor issues on a fine rifle.\nThe rifle uses an 18-inch stainless-steel semi-heavy barrel that measures .727-inch near the muzzle and uses a 1:8 twist rate. The chamber is 5.56 NATO, so it can fire both 5.56 and .223 Remington ammo. The barrel has six flutes that are interrupted by the gas block for the rifle-length gas system. The last \u00be inch of the barrel is stepped down to .705-inch to the muzzle.\nThe barrel is fitted with a 21\u20444-inch long compensator installed with a crush washer. The gun is fitted with a Samson Evolution free-floating handguard. This handguard comes with a rail along the top. There are holes along the sides and bottom to add more rails if you want them. The sides are skeletonized with a double row of cuts on each side to shave off weight and aid heat dissipation. The diameter of the handguard is 1.825-inches, which is easy to grip. The 15-inch handguard extends well past the low profile gas block.\nMost top 3-gun shooters never hold the gun in front of the magazine well. Instead, they will have the weak hand extended way out on the front of the gun for action shooting. This gives much better control of the rifle for lateral movement during rapid target transition. Try this with a short handguard and all you get is burned fingers. I guess my point is this long handguard proves to me that Stag listened to some real shooters when designing the rifle.\nWhen it comes to triggers, many AR builders are stuck on 'Mil Spec Stupid' and forget that shooters need good triggers. It's not uncommon to have precision targets at 500 or 600 yards or even farther in a 3-gun match. It's a huge handicap to have a 10 pound 'battle trigger' that's rougher than Rosie O'Donnell's personality.\nUnless you order a better trigger as an option, almost all rifles will need an expensive replacement before using them in competition.\nOne popular replacement trigger is the Geissele Super 3-Gun trigger. This STAG rifle comes with that trigger as standard equipment. It uses what Geissele calls a \u2018hybrid pull.' It's a longer pull than most match-grade, single-stage triggers, but smooth and clean. On my rifle it breaks at just slightly over 3 pounds.\nThe buttstock and pistol grip are from Magpul, featuring their collapsible ACS buttstock and their MOE hard plastic pistol grip. Both have storage compartments.\nI accuracy tested the rifle by shooting three different factory loads and one handload using bullets ranging from 50-grains to 75-grains. The average for three, 5-shot groups with each of the four loads was 1.23-inches, which is excellent accuracy in any rifle you plan to shoot, particularly right out of the box.", "timestamp": "2019-04-20T15:07:51Z", "url": "https://dailycaller.com/2013/08/15/3-ar-style-rifles-ready-for-3-gun/"}

{"text": "Following the launch of the investigative report Buried alive: a study of the death penalty in Tunisia is launched, ECPM's Middle East and North Africa officer Nicolas Bray presents the research carried out in December 2012.\n- it is a mobilisation tool for Tunisian anti-death penalty activists.\nNicolas Braye is confident that 'the investigative report and the case of Maher Manai will be covered by Tunisian media as a whole'. He stressed how important it was to publicise it in Tunisia first, through a communication campaign and joint efforts with ECPM's local partners who can thus appropriate and use the publication.\nBeyond Tunisian borders, the investigation will be presented at the World Congress in Madrid. ECPM also plans to launch an Arabic version on World Day Against the Death Penalty (10 October 2013) to reach a wider audience. 'We will circulate the Arabic version to our partners across the countries of the region to show an example of a practical campaigning tool, which can be used for advocacy in activism against the death penalty and to raise awareness among the general public,' Nicolas Braye said.\nWhen schools go back in September, ECPM will join forces with the Arab Institute for Human Rights and the French Institute in Tunisia to conduct educational action in secondary schools on the death penalty, again using the report.\nECPM also has plans to follow up on the investigation after its circulation. On the one hand, the organisation will monitor whether the authorities follow any of its recommendations and the situation improves.

{"text": "A warm growing season got turned on it's head when a tropical storm far away in the Pacific dumped 6-7 inches of rain on the Valley just as fruit was getting ripe. After an intense 3 days of rain, the weather was clear and cold. Most fruit had 8-17 days to dry out before being picked, and while the wines show the impact of the rain, they are beautiful and among my favorites to drink (not unlike 2007).\nNote: these wines NEED to be stood upright for several days prior to pulling the cork in order to allow fine sediment to settle out.\nThe Whistling Ridge is red earth and cinnamon over pomegranates, ripe cherries, strawberry fruit leather and dry spices.

{"text": "This hike takes you all the way to the summit of Mt. Minsi on the white-blazed Appalachian Trail with an elevation gain of 1,060 feet in 2 miles. Pick up the trail by following the white blazes at the information boards in the Lake Lenape parking lot. An old paved road until Lake Lenape on the right, the Appalachian Trail then becomes a gravel road and proceeds uphill. Soon the surface levels out and the white blazes leave the gravel road as a footpath to the left.\nYou will rock hop over several small streams along the way but even during times of high water they should be easy to cross. Don't be disappointed by the traffic sounds rising up from I-80 \u2013 you will forget all about that once you look up to see the majestic Mt. Tammany in New Jersey to the left and Mt. Minsi in Pennsylvania to the right. You will be able to look down from the top of the cliffs where you stand to see the Delaware River snaking through the Gap with I-80 and the now much smaller vehicles on the far side of the river.\nJust before one mile, sounds of rushing water lead you to Eureka Creek, the largest stream, which is crossed on rocks. About a quarter of a mile later, although well-marked, you will most likely miss where the trail makes a right turn because you will be mesmerized by the view in front of you, but that is OK, go ahead and keep straight beyond that turn as you will be on an unmarked trail to a view. Just be sure you stop at the end of the trail before going off the cliff! At this spectacular view look over to the right up a steep wall of rocks and you will see a sign that reads 'NOT A TRAIL.' Apparently many hikers have missed the turn and thought this is where the trail continues but that is not the case. Simply retrace your steps for a short distance and watch for the stone steps to your left, the continuation of the white-blazed Appalachian Trail. Go up the steps and follow the white blazes carefully as the trail switchbacks uphill.\nAt 1.75 miles arrive at a woods road, the Mt. Minsi fire road, which will be the return route. The white-blazed trail follows this road briefly to the left then veers back into the woods to the right. Just a short distance ahead arrive at an unmarked T intersection. This is actually the same Mt. Minsi fire road you just crossed which has simply looped around. Turn right here and you will soon see white blazes again. No need to remember this unmarked turn for the return trip because you will be going straight and around the loop which will put you exactly where you need to be to descend on the fire road.\nFor the past quarter mile you have been ascending more towards the interior of the mountain with no views. That will change when you come out to a spectacular full view of Mt. Tammany directly across the way on your left just before the 2-mile mark. With a pair of binoculars you should be able to make out hikers on the summit of Mt. Tammany.\nContinue along the white-blazed trail and pass to the right of a cinder block shed surrounded by a chain link fence and old fire tower footings. A few steps beyond that look to the right for the Mt. Minsi sign on a tree indicating you have arrived at the summit at 1,461 feet. Continue on just a little more to unmarked side trails on the left. These trails take to you views of the Delaware River flowing south as far as the eye can see, forming a dividing line between New Jersey on the left and Pennsylvania on the right.\nTo continue with this hike without additional mileage, retrace your steps back to the cinder block shed then to the view of Mt. Tammany. Keep straight if you happen to remember the unmarked intersection you came in from to the left. Just beyond that intersection, whether you notice it or not, the trail will loop to the left and you soon see the white blazes crossing over. Keep going straight as you are already on the unmarked Mt. Minsi fire road. The descent will be more gradual than the way up on the Appalachian Trail and there won't be any views but there are a couple of interesting side trails worth exploring on the way down. You can shorten the hike to a total of 4.9 miles by staying on the fire road directly back to the parking lot if you prefer.\nTo explore the side trails, after about 1-\u00bc miles on the fire road, start watching for an unmarked woods road on the right. You might first turn on a woods road that ends up going nowhere. That's OK because you will notice that before you have gone too far. If that happens, backtrack and continue on to the next opening on the right. You will know that you found the correct turn when you see another woods road branch off to the left just a short distance in. Continue straight and the woods road will soon make a left turn bringing you to partly-dry Lake Lettini on the left. In the springtime, the loud sounds of various unseen critters in the lake provide a rain forest ambiance. At the next intersection turn left and follow the woods road straight back to the Mt. Minsi fire road. Turn right on the fire road to continue.\nA short distance ahead turn left on an unmarked trail. Watch for another unmarked trail leaving to the left, which brings you to waterfalls in just a few steps. Retrace and continue left on the original unmarked trail. In about .2 mile arrive at Table Rock, a large open expanse of bare rock. Veer left and watch to the right for a view of the Delaware Water Gap at a chain link fence. Continue on along an escarpment where you will see a trail down below, the trail you would be on had you not taken the side trip.\nSoon the trail will descend steeply as Lake Lenape comes into view straight ahead. Arrive at a picnic table at the lake, turn left on the unmarked trail, veer right over an old stone dam, then continue following the trail as it leaves the lake to the left heading towards a couple of houses. At the gravel road, turn right and proceed a short distance over a small hill, arriving back at the parking lot.\nAlthough somewhat dwarfed by the imposing Mt. Tammany, Mt. Minsi offers views of the Delaware Water Gap at least equally as spectacular as those experienced from the top of Mt. Tammany and you might find the trails a bit less crowded.\nCross the toll bridge into Pennsylvania, stay to the right at the tollbooth and immediately take PA Exit 310. Follow signs for Route 611 south down a circular ramp. At the end of the ramp, turn right on Broad Street At the next light turn left onto Route 611 south. Continue a few blocks to the Deerhead Inn on the right. Turn right immediately after the inn on Mountain Road. Take the next left into the Lake Lenape parking area.\nTake PA Exit 310. At the traffic light at the end of the ramp, continue straight on Broad Street. At the next light turn left onto Route 611 south. Continue a few blocks to the Deerhead Inn on the right. Turn right immediately after the inn on Mountain Road. Take the next left into the Lake Lenape parking area.\nI did this hike last week. The way up Mt. Minsi was great (even though the heat & humidity were both way too high). On the way down, the various, listed points of interest (vernal pool, falls, and views) were not much, probably because it was August. My vote would be to forget about the \"Table Rock\" detour, and just go down all the way on the fire road.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T11:51:09Z", "url": "https://www.nynjtc.org/hike/mt-minsi-loop-appalachian-trail"}

{"text": "Today we are talking cake pops. Let me tell you there's an easy way to make cake pops and a hard way. And you guessed it, I found out the hard way of course. You may remember these ones I made for my the Beach House Brat's birthday party. There were only 6 little girls present. I was going to make two each, but I struggled to make it to 7. Making the pops was fine, but I struggled to keep them on the stick and had problems with the chocolate running off because it was too hot. They looked OK and were very yummy, but I had to rest them on their bottoms, because gravity was against me and they kept sliding down the stick. The ribbons saved the day, making them look very pretty, but the effort to wow factor ratio was high and I did wonder whether I'd ever bother again.\nRoll forward several months and it was kind of like having a baby. I forgot everything and jumped right back in.\nI received this cake pop maker from Kambrook, and lets just say, you may be seeing a whole lot more cake pops on this here old blog. This machine and the hot tips in the Kambrook instruction booklet, like 'adding a little vegetable oil to the chocolate melts', really helped to make the cake pop experience much more pleasant indeed.\nThe Kambrook booklet also provides lots of cake pop recipes which are simple. The pops take about 5-6 minutes to cook. The cake pop sticks provided, (24) are washable and reusable. The pops turn out perfectly and any residue easily breaks off. The pan is non stick and just needs a thorough wipe over between batches, so the next batch does not stick.\nThe pops are best covered in chocolate melts, with a good teaspoon of vegetable oil mixed in. This will make the chocolate easier to work with as it cools. Before you start, make sure the chocolate is not too hot, other wise it will just slide off the pop.\nPrick your cake once it has completely cooled on a wire rack, with the sticks provided.\nHold the pop over the chocolate bowl and use a spoon to drizzle it with chocolate, gently shake off any excess chocolate and place in the stand to dry.\nDipping the balls into the bowl is a no no, as it may lead to them falling into the chocolate and a God awful mess.\nWhilst they are drying, make your plum pudding decorations. I used red smarties and jelly babies roughly cut to the shape of a leaf.\nAllow the first coat of chocolate to completely dry. Meanwhile fill a clip lock plastic bag with melted white chocolate (again the melts are the best). Squeeze the chocolate into one corner of the bag. Snip the tinniest corner from the bag and pipe a good dose of chocolate onto the top centre of your pop. It should run down the sides by itself. Place the lollies on top, which will assist in making the white chocolate run down the sides for effect as well.\nThis was a shot I took when I made chocolate crackle plum puddings last holiday season.\nAs you can see, a generous amount of white chocolate is fine.\nAnd the cake pop recipe I used from the Kambrook book.\n2. In a bowl mix all ingredients with a whisk until combined.\n4. Remove using heatproof tongs and place onto cake rack to cool completely, before decorating as described as above.\nNow for the best bit, I am giving away a Kambrook cake pop maker to an Australian reader of Desire Empire.\nFor all my other Christmas baking and craft projects go here.\nThis competition is open from now until 7 December 2012 12pm Australian EST.\nI was not paid to write this post, but I received a cake pop maker to review. Clearly I liked it.\nmmmm i'm making cake pops in a couple of weeks (old fashioned way and first timer), now i'm nervous!\nThis feels like comment spam, but here goes.....

I've never liked the original cake pops (cake mixed with cream and rolled into balls) because they were just a bit too sweet for my liking. Glad Kambrook came up with a way to have cake on its own in the pops :) Need to get myself one of these!\nI like cake pops but not for me to bake. These look delicious.\nlast but not least I'm following in Instagram!\nI always I feel like I put on weight just reading your blog! It always makes me salivate, it's terrible for my diet!

And I'm completely taken with those dear little Christmas puds. So cute. That's something the kids could eat on Chrissy Day without having to tackle the whole fruit cake thing. Great idea. So yes please put me in the running. I already like and follow you on all those things.\nI lie, I wasn't following you on Pinterest, but that seems weird, I'm sure I follow people and it drops off because I have had to refollow quite a few people lately that I was following before.

Count me into the comp. Follow on Facebook.\nI have had the same trouble making cake pops with the balls falling off the sticks, chocolate and sprinkles dripping on the sticks and table. Kambrook seems to have clicked onto this new trend and would so love to win this and use it because I won't be attempting to make cake pops again unless I use Kambrook!!!\nI love, love, LOVE these cake pops. How do you like the cake pop maker? Is it just cake inside the make you use and no frosting too? If so, do not not break up when dipping? And I love the fact that you used a Smartie on top too. I'm in the UK and we have Smarties here too. It was kinda hard to explain that Smarties are like M&M's but flatter and more crunchier than M&M's when someone asked what Smarties were, hehe.\nMy kids want one of these so badly - they look like lots of fun!\nThankyou for the chance to win, these look gorgeous!\nThey look fantastic!

{"text": "I chose to major in Business with a concentration in Marketing because I wanted to learn the best ways of setting myself apart from others with my future business endeavors. I have been a hairstylist for the past 9 years and plan to open my own hair salon soon after graduating. Although I have the technical skills required to run a salon, I knew that I needed to understand the business side as well if I want to succeed.\nI am beyond honored to be recognized as a Dean's Scholar because I have worked extremely hard to get to this point. I started my educational journey at Cabrillo College which is the community college in my area. I attended Cabrillo for 4 years and have spent the last 2 years at SJSU all while working full time and building up my business. Although my life has been hectic with both working and going to school full time, I have always made it a priority to be the best student I can, to take advantage of my education, and to maintain a high GPA. It feels really fantastic to be recognized for all of my hard work. Thank you!\nMy husband, Josh Anacleto, has always been my biggest support system and influence in life. When I mentioned that I wanted to go to school and get a business degree a little over 6 years ago, he was nothing but positive and supportive of the idea. He appreciates and values education and has believed in me from the very beginning. He has sacrificed a lot for me to be able to fulfill my dreams and goals and I am forever grateful for him.\nAlthough I have had many wonderful professors during my time at SJSU, one that really shines through is Professor Reiko Kataoka. I have to say she has influenced me greatly. She teaches linguistics, which fulfilled a required area outside of my major, and her positive attitude, amazing ability to teach a difficult subject, and her passion for her students has truly inspired me. She instilled in me the desire to keep reaching for my dreams no matter how difficult or far fetched they may seem. She is a true testament to what a university professor should be!\nThe day I decided to pursue further education after beginning my career is what truly changed my life. Since making the decision to begin my college journey, I now see very clearly exactly where I want my life and career to go. I have always wanted to be a business owner and now I am able to meld my two passions, cosmetology and business, together and couldn't be more excited!\nWhen you get to college, it is your responsibility to yourself to do the very best you can. You owe yourself that! It isn't just about getting decent grades, going through the motions and getting out to find a job. It is about learning who you really are and what you want in life. It is a journey through and through. Truly, it goes by like the blink of an eye and if you don't stop and savor it every now and then you will miss it. Make the most of your time at SJSU, get involved, make contacts and enjoy the ride!\nI am a fighter. I always have been and always will be. I am dedicated and work hard for what I want in life. I never give up and I am proud to call myself a Spartan for life!", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T12:05:53Z", "url": "http://www.sjsu.edu/provost/events/honors/featured/2018/april_anacleto/index.html"}
{"text": "Growing up in the bush on Canada's west coast, Glenn Raynor spent much of his boyhood immersed in the natural world\u2014tracking baby bears through the lush forest and watching orcas migrate in spring. Today, Glenn is the executive director of the Jane Goodall Institute's office in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), but his love and respect for wildlife can be traced back to his days roaming British Columbia's wilderness. Glenn's work in the DRC is fundamental to the protection of chimpanzees in the region, which is intimately connected to the health of the communities that border the forests where wildlife live. In many villages, high levels of infant and maternal death are a major issue. In response, Glenn and his staff are executing the Delivering Healthy Futures project that is helping reduce maternal and infant mortality rates in 20 communities throughout North Kivu and Maniema provinces in the eastern DRC. Strengthening local health systems and providing training in family planning is contributing to the conservation of a critical biodiversity hot spot that is paramount to the survival of chimpanzees. While this might sound like a straightforward concept ripe for execution, the DRC is fraught with a unique set of challenges. 'The Congo is the most complex and most critical country to work in in Africa,' says Glenn. 'You have to get the formula right.' What Glenn observed in the field was troubling. National parks were getting little support. Deforestation, habitat loss and poaching threatened populations of great apes at alarming rates. And the rangers who risk their lives every day to protect the wildlife are paid next to nothing.\nPark rangers on anti-poaching patrol in Kahuzi-Biega National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nIn an effort to address some of these issues and protect important regions for wildlife and habitat, JGI's programming in the Congo is based on community-centered conservation. This means building local capacity and creating programs that are controlled and embraced by the local people. Glenn emphasizes that communities need to be engaged as full partners to achieve conservation goals. 'Unless you can engage people\u2014stewards of the last remaining wilderness areas\u2014no conservation scheme will work,' says Glenn.\nThough he is still relatively new to the job, Glenn is looking to the future. His long-term vision is a JGI-funded, Congolese-run office in the DRC that will be a catalyst for achieving ambitious conservation objectives. 'The Congo is one of the most difficult places to work but if we can do this, we will set the gold standard,' says Glenn. 'We are small but mighty because we work with the Congolese and international partners.' Glenn hopes that part of the transformation will be led by youth through Jane Goodall's Roots & Shoots program. Promoting a greater awareness of the challenges faced by people and animals and mobilizing support for youth-led campaigns will help accomplish the revitalization of national parks. The Delivering Healthy Futures project and other vital programming in the DRC would not be possible without Glenn, his dedicated staff and volunteers\u2014working on the ground and learning how best to support communities with regards to sustainability, health and conservation, in a highly complex and volatile area.\nNo matter the size, your gift will have a meaningful impact on communities across the globe.", "timestamp": "2019-04-18T19:15:45Z", "url": "https://janegoodall.ca/our-stories/dr-congo-field-staff-spotlight-glenn-raynor-2/"}
{"text": "Alexander Greschner, CSO Wacker Neuson SE speaks with LECTURA Press about Wacker Neuson Zero Emission equipment and machines, new product launches and the increasing digitization and automation of the industry.\nA look at the upcoming fairs: Can you tell us more about the products and technologies to be launched later this year?\nWacker Neuson is already a leader in zero emission construction equipment and machinery. We are continuing to expand this pioneering role. This year's new addition to the series are the electric vibration plate 1850e, which has the same battery as the battery-powered steamer, which has been on the market for years, and the all-electric EZ17e mini excavator. Another highlight will be the launch of our Dual View dumpers, which will establish new standards for construction site safety. A 180 \u00b0 turn of the entire operating and control console ensures optimum visibility for the machine operator.\nWith the ET35 and the EZ36, Wacker Neuson is introducing two new 3.5 ton excavators to its machine park. What are the defining features of these machines?\nFor the 3.5 ton mini excavators, well-proven features of larger models have been consistently enhanced. A completely new design and interior as well as additional equipment options ensure a productive and fatigue-free working environment. Both models are characterized by fast work cycles, as well as very precise and efficient work. This is made possible by optimized hydraulics and the revised engine-pump management system. The EZ36 was designed to be a Zero Tail excavator without a tail swing, especially for jobs on narrow construction sites, as is often the case in inner-city areas.\nDigitization - What requirements does Industry 4.0 place on the sale of construction machinery?\nWe divide the field of digitization into three areas: Smart Production, Smart Office and Connected Site. The key aspect for us is that all these different areas can provide a clear customer benefit. We see great potential particularly in the areas of training and services. After the first on site tests with customers and dealers, we were able to clearly determine that we have taken the right path and that we can significantly increase efficiency and speed with the help of digitization.\nWhat role will data play in the world of construction machinery in the future?\nToday, but also in the future, fleet management and service-supporting solutions will play an important role, for example for machine localization services, efficiency monitoring and enhancement. Machine data is also used to speed up the solution of machine errors, and thereby increasing machine uptime. For example, the machine sends an error code to the service technician which assured that information relevant to the maintenance and correction of the malfunction is available to the driver prior to the start. In the long term, the frequency of machine maintenance will also be reduced as maintenance can be adjusted according to the condition of the machine and its actual use.\nDo you like this interview?

{"text": "The successful transformation of any large organization ultimately requires the evaluation and enhancement of the processes in place to plan and manage the financial resources of the organization. It is critical that the organization has the effective and relevant information needed to drive key decisions related to the allocation and distribution of resources.\nTo that end, the Transformation Team has in place an initiative focused on transforming the budget management system of California State Parks into a mechanism that will determine the level of service the parks can provide at varying levels of funding. This data will help the department set program and service priorities.\nCollect the more detailed level of data needed to truly understand the tasks and level of effort required to operate the department and allow it to meet its mission.\nAllow district superintendents and park managers to understand how to maintain service levels in a flexible and cost-effective way.\nAllow park managers to be held accountable for annual program and service outcomes.\nIn January, the Committee launched a pilot SBB budgeting effort in the Gold Field District, Northern Service Center and in 16 individual parks across 10 districts. The pilot was a resounding success with 100 percent reporting on time. The pilot also demonstrated the value of peer knowledge via the Yammer online forum. Yammer allowed pilot participants to post and read all the issues and questions being raised and to rapidly see the solutions offered by their contemporaries as well as from SBB team members.\nWhat's next? SSB will be rolled out to all remaining parks and units (except those in the pilot) including headquarters units scheduled to begin March 21 with a May 6 completion date. As the department works through this process, there will be plenty of help. Staff will be provided training and a user guide will be available.\nMeanwhile, the committee will begin development of a budget management system to create an ability to analyze, evaluate and report on the data generated. The financial information generated from SBB will greatly assist leadership in developing, presenting and advocating for the 2017/2018 budget for California State Parks.\nStay abreast of the Transformation Team's progress on their website.\nThe Transformation Team is interested to know your ideas, thoughts and comments.

{"text": "Motivating yourself to be more frugal and manage your money more effectively can be very challenging!\nOne strategy that may help is to focus on multiple benefits, rather that just the most obvious or immediate one. A prime example is using your car less often. Although the price of gasoline isn't as steep as it used to be, daily use of your automobile could easily result in less money in your pocket (or bank account) at the end of the month. While many of us are in the habit of jumping in our car every time we need to pick up a few odds and ends at the corner drugstore or neighborhood supermarket, you'll invariably save money \u2013and often enjoy other benefits\u2013 if you consider alternatives to automobile use.\nWalk instead of drive. If you're fortunate enough to live relatively close to stores that you frequent, you could save money on gas and automobile maintenance by putting on your walking shoes more often and hoofing it. As a secondary benefit, you'd also be getting exercise, burning calories, getting fresh air, and taking in some essential vitamin D from the sun. By taking steps to maintain your health, you'll also have more energy, be more productive, and tend to miss fewer days of work. Not everyone lives close enough to local stores to be able to walk there on a regular basis (or at all), but for those who do, there are many advantages.\nCarpool to work. This option doesn't occur to everyone because, among other things, we're creatures of habit. We get in the well-worn habit of driving back and forth to work by ourselves, every day, and we don't stop to think that there is a money-saving alternative. When you share the cost and responsibility of driving, you're literally cutting your commuting expenses in half. You're also getting a break from the stress and tedium of commuting in rush-hour traffic. Having someone to talk to during the drive can also make the trip go by much faster \u2014 assuming you enjoy the company of your carpooling companion(s)!\nPublic transportation may be a viable alternative. If you happen to live and work in an urban environment, you may already be availing yourself of the benefits of public transportation. In addition to saving money on gas and avoiding driving-related stress, there's the added benefit of being able to read a book, listen to relaxing music, or prepare for a presentation on your way in.\nTelecommute whenever possible. More and more employers are helping themselves and their employees save money by offering work-from-home options. If you have the opportunity to telecommute a couple days a week, the savings in gas, wear-and-tear on your car, and the cost of lunches out can add up quickly!\nIf it looks like you're filling up your gas tank every time you turn around, not to mention burning through your paycheck too fast, then finding ways to reduce gas consumption may be one way to stretch your dollar farther.", "timestamp": "2019-04-23T17:56:45Z", "url": "http://blog.metrowestpremierhomes.com/easy-ways-to-reduce-your-car-expenses/"}
{"text": "The education of a child begins twenty years before his birth, with the education of his mother. Is not there a part of truth in this phrase of Napoleon? Have not the experience and scientific studies shown that the mother deeply imprints on her child what she is? If there is a period during which the mother plays a preponderant role in what will be the trends and moral habits of her child, it is certainly the prenatal period, during which the mother can say with all truth. I am something he, And he is something of my own, so intimate is the organic participation of the child and his mother; So great is also the interdependence in the physical and in the moral.\nIn the course of those nine months of re-education, the mother must think: I can help my son to become what I should be myself, I can help him to be calm, staying calm, to be smiling if I smile, To be strong being me brave, to be good being me kindly for all.\nAnd on the supernatural level, how much grace can a mother surround her child however little she thinks of from time to time in the presence in her of Christ by grace and in her little by blood. Will mystique be said? The simple logic of our faith. It is not wasted time for a future mother who reserves each day, for example, in the early afternoon a few minutes of rest stretched. A wonderful occasion to return to inner tranquility. The best physical and psychological conditions for the child to develop as healthy as possible are those that result from being much desired.\nSome children become almost guilty of being born. The child not only needs food; He also needs affection. There are children who are desired by the mother as compensation for their marital failure; this is a selfish desire: for his own sake he wants to be again in him; it is almost a role of the avenging child that is wanted to make him represent. This is not a guarantee of good development; On the contrary, the best conditions take place when the child is desired not only as a child but as a consecration of mutual love; That is, when the woman wants a 'son of her husband', and the husband, his wife.\nThe solidarity so intimate that unites the mother with her son, far from disappearing when it comes to the world, continues a long time still. That is why it is so essential that the mother herself be responsible for the education and care of her son and not be resigned to entrusting to others more than in a case of force majeure.\nChildren should learn to be alone, to have fun alone. If the mother or caregiver manages to fill every minute, they become accustomed to being amused, and then can become insatiable tyrants. I know children who have captured their mother since the early years, constantly asking them Mom, what do I do?' Or Mom tells me a story. I'm so bored. These poor children suffer as a result of their continuous Agitation, and the vacuum of time is an impossible problem for them. With her maternal and irreplaceable smile, much more than giving in to the whims of her son is how the mother gives her ration of affection.\nReasoning with very young children should be kept to a minimum since they are not yet in possession of their logical thinking. To want to make him reason too soon is as if he wanted to get her to walk at six months. He runs the risk of making him sick for his entire life. One of the greatest services you can provide the child is to regulate their automatisms because it is to release it later on obstacles, cares, uncertainties, inhibitions. Facilitate your moral and physical development: help you conquer your true freedom. Order and regularity are almost as indispensable at this age as affection. It is up to you, your mother, who at six months the child can read.\nThe book where the child will learn to discern what is necessary to do or not to do is your face, with its different expressions. You know what you want from him, and every time his way corresponds to your will, your look and smile will tell you, it's okay. When the loving gaze and smile disappear and are replaced by a serious expression, the child will have the impression of an is wrong. Your language, although he does not yet understand words, has a meaning that he appreciates. A ton of anger and a touch of carers are not the same for him; the inflections of your voice remarkably reinforce the understanding of your smile or your seriousness.\nIt is a contradiction to force a child to repeat twenty times the good morning to the same person under the pretext of accustoming him or to amuse the participants. The little ones wish to behave like old people, and they repudiate the office of wise dogs, and if it did not disgust them, it would be even worse, because it supposes that it has the soul of traveling comedians. Avoid talking to your child in baby language, however endearing it may be. You will do a bad service imitating his way of expressing himself. It will be useful for you later to teach him to correctly pronounce his mother tongue and make him repeat the faulty turns.\nThe role of the father in these first years of the existence of his children is and should certainly be less prominent. Undoubtedly, he can express to his children their nascent tenderness: Man, in general, is not appropriate to manifest such feelings. It is convenient and good that he sometimes takes care of them so that they become accustomed to him and him to his children. But do not try to dominate prematurely on the role of the mother, creating an easy popularity. Is not the new element, to which children see less than the mother, and who can by this fact only have a particular appeal? Let it be dark for the time being in relation to his young children to leave the mother the first role.\nIt is to be hoped that the strong authority conferred upon her by her physical strength, the vigor of her voice, will ever contribute to the authority of the mother when she is weary and incapable of carrying out the educating task alone. However, this should occur most rarely, especially in the face of the very small. The disproportion of forces creates fear in the child. Fear is the unconscious that is revealed, and it is also the inhibition of the best faculties. Complete education with fear is not achieved. It seems to us preferable that his authority is exercised directly in the form of full approval of the maternal decisions.\nIf the husband does not approve of his wife in any or all of his acts in relation to his children, let him tell her alone, explaining the reasons. Man, who sees things more outward, also sees farther and more widely, and can give useful advice to his wife in regard to education; And we say a piece of advice and not that bitter criticism that discourages us, and less a sterile mockery or derision. Keep yourself from these angry interventions, where many parents find an apparent satisfaction in their role as the educator. He must not be a machine that makes serious observations, exemplary punishments, and all that dramatic and harmful apparatus in education. His firm calm and the clarity of a reprimand will be worth more than a disordered attitude of an angry father.\nDo not worry about not having your children. The violence of the gestures, the extreme swelling of the voice, the glaring glances, are often in his manifestations of a temporary nervousness and of no importance for the adult, but they exert on the small unexpected repercussions. It is up to you, mothers, to interest your husband in the life of the child. Instead of jealously guarding for your discoveries and intuitions, reveal them, make them observe the awakening of their faculties and all the signs of their development.\nMutual trust will Educational benefit your effort. Nothing enhances the confidence of a husband in his wife but helps her to penetrate the intimate secret of that little being, all enigmas, to whom they have given their life together.", "timestamp": "2019-04-22T03:04:40Z", "url": "http://dldxedu.com/conditions-for-the-success-of-education/"}

Patent #636,197.\nThis date marks the birth of Ethel Waters. She was an African-American entertainer, vocalist, and actress.\nWith smooth, well-defined phrasing and a meticulous sense of timing, the singing style of Ethel Waters rated with the best of the era's vocalists, making her a popular figure during the Harlem Renaissance. By the mid-\u201820s Waters had stopped singing the blues. She was the first woman to perform W.C. Handy's 'St. Louis Blues.' Her style changed to that of a successful pop singer. Waters performed in a number of revues, including Africana, Paris Bound, and The Ethel Waters Broadway Revue. In 1929 she landed her first acting role in the film On with the Show. She appeared in Pinky in 1949, which won her an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.\nOn Broadway Ethel Waters appeared in Mamba's Daughters, though her greatest theatrical achievement was in 1950 when she played a cook in the play The Member of the Wedding and won the New York Drama Critics Award for best actress. She penned two autobiographies, His Eye Is on the Sparrow and To Me It's Wonderful. Ethel Waters also toured with evangelist Billy Graham from 1957 until her death on September 1, 1977.\nJulia Lee was born on this date. She was an African-American singer and pianist.\nJulia Lee was born in Boonville, Missouri and raised in Kansas City, where she attended Lincoln High School. As a child, she performed with her father's string trio, as well as at neighborhood house parties and church socials. She began her professional musical career singing and playing the piano in her brother's band, George E. Lee and His Novelty Singing Orchestra.\nHis band formed around 1920 and, among the Black musical groups in the Kansas City area, was the biggest rival of the Bennie Moten Orchestra during that decade. George Lee's band featured outstanding singers and soloists. It was also the training ground for a many talented young musicians, including, briefly, Charlie Parker. In 1935, Lee launched an independent career. Lee was known for her husky voice, her straightforward piano style, and the easy, heartfelt way of singing. In a professional career that spanned four decades, Lee built a national reputation as one of the great female blues singers of all time.\nA major figure in the blues revival that followed World War II, her trademark was double-entrendres, or, as she once said, 'the songs my mother taught me not to sing.' She made several hit records in the 1940s. Come On Over to My House Baby led to a recording contract with Capitol Records in 1946. Snatch and Grab It, (1947), sold a half million copies. She worked primarily in the mid-west and frequently teamed up with the great drummer Samuel 'Baby' Lovett. In 1949, Lee and Lovett played at the White House at the invitation of President Harry Truman.\nLee was married for a time to baseball player and manager Frank Duncan, of the Kansas City Monarchs. At the time of her death on December 8, 1958 in San Diego, she was one of the most popular performers in Kansas City.\nIllinois Jacquet was born on this date. He was an African-American Tenor saxophonist.\nHe has virtually built a career on that solo, which he claims, came from divine inspiration; it ranks as one of the best improvisational performances in the 20th century. His raw-boned tenor sound combining R&B boldness and jazz sophistication is his trademark. He performed in the Jazz At The Philharmonic series, appeared in the jazz documentary, Jammin' The Blues and in 1945 formed his own band. From the \u201850s to the present, Jacquet has recorded for many labels including Savoy, RCA, Mercury, Epic, and Atlantic.\nInto the 21st century, Jacquet lead one of the best swing big bands on the scene and performed with the same intensity that marked his ascendancy more than 50 years ago. Illinois Jacquet died on July 21, 2004.\nJohn Henry Lewis wins the world light heavyweight crown in St. Louis, Missouri by defeating Bob Olin.

Lloyd is actually one of three African Americans to become NBA players in the 1950 season. The other two are Nat 'Sweetwater' Clifton and Chuck Cooper. Lloyd will play 9 solid NBA seasons from 1950 to 1960.\nJohn Harding Lucas II is born in Durham, North Carolina. He will become a professional basketball player and play guard for the Houston Rockets and Milwaukee Bucks. He will become a NBA coach after retiring as a player. He will coach the San Antonio Spurs, Philadelphia 76ers and Cleveland Cavaliers, each for less than two seasons, compiling a 174 - 258 overall record. Prior to accepting the head coaching position for the Cavaliers, he will be an assistant coach for the Denver Nuggets for three seasons.\nOn this date, Algeria gained independence from France.\nFor more than a century, the Algerian people fought a permanent armed, moral, and political struggle against the invader and all its forms of oppression after the aggression of 1830 against the Algerian State and the occupation of the country by the French colonialist forces. In the conflict the National Liberation Front called for the mobilization of all the energies of the nation, the process of struggle for independence having reached its final realization stage.\nThe war of extermination carried on by the French imperialism became more intensive, and more than a million martyrs died for the love of the homeland and liberty. In March 1962, the people came out victorious from a struggle that lasted seven and a half years led by the National Liberation Front. Having recovered its sovereignty after 132 years of colonial domination under a feudal system, Algeria gave itself new national political institutions.\nFaithful to the program adopted by the National Council of the Algerian Revolution in Tripoli, the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria moved its activities in the process of building of the country in conformity with the principles of socialism and the effective exercise of power by the people, of whom the fellahs, the working masses, and the revolutionary intellectuals constitute the ultramodern.\nA racially motivated civil disturbance occurs in Jacksonville, Florida.

{"text": "What's so good about being a teacher?\nAn article in The Age this morning and the subsequent twitter conversation has got me thinking about why I became a teacher and, more importantly, why I've stayed a teacher for the last 7 years.\nI came to teaching later in life \u2013 graduated when I was 31. I'd already got an Arts degree, had travelled, had tried out innumerable other jobs and hadn't found any that really fitted. Then my best friend went back to University to study teaching and started telling me stories of classroom life. Teaching was something that I think had always been in the back of my mind but I hadn't felt ready before.\nGetting in to a teaching course, even as a mature age student, was challenging with limited places being offered for postgraduates at the time (my course had space for 6 people). But once I was in, I knew it was the right fit and the right time. Others didn't and the numbers dwindled, particularly in the undergraduate course that we shared classes with. Noticeably, numbers were always somewhat diminished after teaching rounds, as if the reality of daily life with students was enough to put some people off.\nIn my first teaching role, my colleague referred to me as \u2018the enthusiastic graduate' and, even though the graduate bit is no longer true, the enthusiasm is still there. I honestly love being a teacher. I won't pretend there aren't bits that I would happily give away but the highs definitely make up for it. Seeing students eager to return after the holidays and to share their adventures with you. Watching a Prep student \u2018click' and read a book for the first time. Helping a Grade 6 student who has always hated writing connect with a topic so strongly that he doesn't want to go outside when the lunch bell goes. Catching a parent after school to tell them how confident their child was when giving their talk in class and watching the parent beam with pride. Getting into the zone with colleagues when planning exciting learning experiences, ones that you're looking forward to because you know how much the students will love them. Connecting with students each day and watching them grow and develop.\nI could go on \u2013 the list of positives is a long one and I truly hope that we can find a way to attract more passionate, caring, professional, intelligent and dedicated people to the teaching profession. Is the answer to put an arbitrary hike on ATAR scores so that we restrict it to those with the highest Year 12 marks? I doubt it. I know some amazing teachers who didn't do so well in Year 12 for a variety of reasons who would have been locked out if that were the case. Or is the answer making students go through an undergraduate generalist degree before attempting a postgraduate degree in education? I don't think there are any easy, one size fits all answers. What we do need to do is raise the profile of teaching and of teachers, however we can.

{"text": "Well, the boys are back in town, and this time they're going to let you take a few balls to the face right along with them, all in glorious 3D! That's right, finally a movie that truly deserves the 3D treatment. I know, it sounds like a joke, but after seeing it for myself, Jackass 3D just might be exactly what 3D movies needed. You might also think that it's just going to be a series of cheesy and vulgar things being poked at the audience, but it's not\u2026 Well, maybe at times, but they actually use the 3D technology to its absolute best capabilities. In a previous review, I mentioned that one of the biggest problems with 3D movies these days is that some of the faster action sequences tend to cause the images to blur and sometimes loose their effect. I also recently mentioned that the use of 3D and high speed slow motion in Resident Evil: Afterlife was an excellent way of capturing the full potential of this modern resurgence of 3D cinema. Surprisingly Jackass 3D manages to take that concept to a whole new level. I think one of the most surprising things about Jackass 3D, is that they really planned each stunt to utilize the depth of each shot, but they also made sure the enjoyment wouldn't be lost in 2D viewings, which is more than I would have ever expected from them. Speaking of 2D, I love the fact that a 3D movie chose to open their movie with a pair of 2D characters presented in 3D. I don't want to ruin the surprise, so I'll just leave it at that, but trust me it's good. If you've seen the previous Jackass movies, you'll know that this is most likely the most you'll laugh at a movie all year, and it could very well be the last one. The guys are definitely getting older, and I would have to imagine that the idea of retirement has got to be creeping its way into their minds by now. But, I can tell you, that you will be able to see something in Jackass 3D that you've never seen in a Jackass movie before. What could that possibly be, you ask? Well, I'll tell you. Steve-O doing stunts\u2026 Let me finish! Steve-O doing stunts totally sober. And, you can totally tell. He's much more aware of the things about to happen, and he almost seems nervous at times.

I think my favorite line of the entire movie would have to be, 'You looked like Buck Rogers traveling in time.' I laughed my ass off during this movie, and I would highly recommend seeing it 3D. It's well wroth the higher ticket price. And, what would a Jackass movie be without a big\u2026 Scratch that. A huge closing sequence, and Jackass 3D does not disappoint.

{"text": "For Honor update 1.26 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is now available for download. According to the official For Honor 1.26 patch notes, the new update has added a new map, a new seasonal event, major updates for two Heroes, and other new features. In addition, For Honor version 1.26 comes with various bug fixes and improvements.\nZone Attack can now be chained into Heavy Finisher.\nDeveloper comment: The Heavy Finisher link gives the Warden new options to link up to do additional damage, especially with the new soft feint Shoulder Bash off Heavy Finisher (see below).\n'Crushing Counterstrike' no longer guarantees a Shoulder Bash (it still links into it, however).\n'Crushing Counterstrike' now guarantees a Top Light.\nDeveloper comment: ' Crushing Counterstrike' already deals quite a large amount of damage, and leading into a guaranteed extra damage was too strong. Instead, you can now go into a guaranteed Top Light, which leads to additional follow-ups that are not guaranteed.\nCharge time for maximum charge is 1000ms (up from 800ms).\nMaximum charge hits at 300ms (down from 400ms).\nCan be cancelled into a Feint at any point before movement starts.\nYou have up to 100ms after releasing the 'Guard Break' button to feint.\nDeveloper comment: The intent for this new version of Shoulder Bash is to have both a strong opener that forces a reaction from your opponent and has options to beat every single defensive option your opponent possesses.\nTop Heavy Finisher is now unblockable, hits at 1100ms (up from 800ms) and costs 6 stamina (down from 12).\nSide Heavy Finishers now deal 40 damage (up from 35) and costs 6 stamina (down from 12).\nDeveloper comment: The Warden's Heavy Finishers are very rarely used outside of feinting, and this change makes the top unblockable, giving the Warden a great tool in-group fights.\nSide Lights are now 500ms (down from 600ms).\n1st Side Light now does 12 damage (was 15).\n2nd Side Light now does 6 damage (was 9).\nDeveloper comment: The Warden's opening game was quite weak (against a Warden, you always guarded top and switched your guard to beat Zone Attacks). With this change, all of his opening lights are 500ms, and as such, this increases the opening pressure the Warden can use on his opponents.\nThe Warden now has a brand new attack \u2013 Dash Forward + Heavy.\nCosts 12 stamina to use.\nStarts at 300ms in the Dash Forward movement.\nAlways hits from the Top.\nDeveloper comment: The Warden needs an attack with a lot of forward movement to help close in the gap against more mobile heroes as well as to catch roll attempts. This attack solves both problems and rounds out his kit much more.\nThe Warden's Sprint attack now chains to Heavy Finishers (both out of lock and locked).\nDeveloper comment: This change was made to have consistency between the new Forward Dash Heavy attack and his Sprint attack. It also adds viability to his Sprint attack, making it more effective.\nDeveloper comment: This gives the Valkyrie a more fluid and much better path to her mix-ups. Note that Shield Crush (on Hit or Miss) and Shield Tackle (on Hit) still count as a Light chain starter.\nNEW INPUT: Now performed by pressing X.\nIs now 500ms (down from 600ms).\nCan now sweep multiple targets (Friendly and enemy).\nAll Sweep no longer chain to regular attack.\nSweep Attack is no longer guaranteed after a throw.\nCan be done from the hit recovery of a successful Sweep Attack (From 600 to 800ms) with Heavy Attack.\nDoes 25 damage and costs 12 Stamina.\nShield Crush Miss Recovery has been reduced to 600ms (from 900ms), and you can now branch to chain attacks at 300ms (was 500ms).\nShield Crush can no longer be performed from Heavy Attack recovery.\nShield Crush is no longer performed after a chained attack. Now, it is only performed as a Cancel from any Heavy Attack in the chain.\nDeveloper comment: Shield Crush now guarantees the 2nd Light Attack in the Chain.\nThere is no longer an uncharged and charged Shield Tackle. Now, the only version of the move does not cause Unbalance.\nShield Tackle no longer has Full Block Stance during the Strike portion.\nShield Tackle can now be feinted from the move entry, loop and beginning of the strike with B.\nIt is no longer possible to cancel Shield Tackle with a back dodge.\nRemoved the charge from the Valkyrie's Headbutt (Front Throw).\nHeadbutt is now a normal Front Throw.\nThrow's connection to Sweep are now at 700ms for the front, right and left throw (was 600ms) and 1100ms for the back throw (was 1000ms).\nTop Finisher Light Attacks are now 400ms (down from 600ms).\nSide Finisher Light Attacks are now 500ms (down from 600ms).\nThe Valkyrie's Side Light Finishers now have Special Hit Reaction that push the opponent on hit, and can stagger opponents if they hit walls.\nWhen the Valkyrie blocks attacks with her Superior Block when using Light Attack Openers, the attack becomes Unblockable and does 27 damage.\nNow Count as Chain Starter.\nRemoved the branching to Shield Crush.\nShoulder Pin is now guaranteed on a successful Dodge Block.\nDeveloper comment: Shoulder Pin was a very risky move for very little reward \u2013 being guaranteed now, you can safely use it every time a Dodge Block connects.\nAdded a 200ms Feint Clip after the second strike of the zone attack.\nThe second hit of the Valkyrie's Zone Attack can now be cancelled into Shield Crush at 400ms.\nThe second hit of the Valkyrie's Zone Attack is now feinted at 400ms (was at 100ms) to prevent a flicker issue.\nSecond hit of the Zone Attack is now 800ms (was 700ms).\nDodge Attacks now launch at 300ms into the Dodge (was 0ms).\nDodge Recovery is now 600ms (down from 700ms).\nShoulder Pin now deals 20 Health 15 Bleed (3dmg/2sec for 10sec) from 1 Health 15 Bleed.\nLight opener now deals 15 damage (up from 12).\n2nd Light in a chain now deals 13 (down from 18).\nTop Light Finisher now deals 12 damage. (Down from 20).\nSide Light Finisher now deal 12 Damage and Stuns.\nIt is told that the Secluded Keep was the personal retreat of a pious Lord. He lived the life of a monk in the fortress, paying daily homage to his ancestors. When the war arrived, armies saw the strategic value of a fortified castle surrounded by waters and invaded it. What was once a haven has become a highly disputed outpost holding precious supplies.\nAvailable in Duel, Brawl, Skirmish, Elimination and Tribute.\nPlayers that complete a tournament get one guaranteed item from the current tier plus one reward from all the tiers below.\nDeveloper comments: We hope to make tournaments more competitive with these changes, minimizing the need to lose on purpose to get items from the other tiers. We also believe that the random number generator was making the system's perception more complex than what it actually is.\nRewards from Previous seasons are back!\nIf you win (and you have not collected all the ornaments), you are guaranteed to get one ornament.\nThe priority of the reward is still for the last hero played.\nThere isn't a priority between seasons (you can get a Season 4 reward on the first try, then a Season 3 and then only after, a Season 7 ornament). They don't drop in order of the season.\nAfter you looted all the ornaments for the last hero played, you are going to get a random ornament.\nOnce you looted them all, you get a reward from the tier below for the last hero played and so it goes until you looted them all.\nDeveloper comments: Thanks to your feedback, we have decided to reintroduce all season's rewards for tournaments.\nAll Tournament Rewards can be acquired in Ranked Matches (Including Ornaments).\nAt the end of each Ranked match win, players have a low chance of getting a tournament reward from each tier.\nRewards are also prioritized for the last hero played.\nDeveloper comments: We are testing new ways to encourage players to play ranked modes. Let us know what you think!\nIntroducing 2 new divisions in our Ranking System: Master and Grand Master for the best warriors of the current Season!\nWhen you complete the 5th Tier of Diamond Division, now you enter the Master Rank. Keep an eye on your Skill Rating progress with the new Ranking Leaderboard!\nThe top 100 players of Master Division become ranked in Grand Master!\nBeware, after 14 days of inactivity, a Skill Rating penalty starts to be applied everyday so that players can't stagnate indefinitely in the Grand Master Division leaderboard.\nDeveloper comments: As announced during the ranked play introduction, we're finally adding the end goal in Ranked play thanks to those two new Divisions. Now players can fight to reach Grand Master Rank Division and the top of its leaderboard .\nThe Ranked Front is updated based on all the changes being done in Ranked play. To focus the community on the new leaderboard and Master divisions, Ranked Duel matches can now be played outside tournaments. Tournaments will be only triggered in rotation, starting on a week-end basis. Ranked Dominion playlist is being removed for the moment.\nDeveloper comments: Thanks to the major update regarding Ranked play, we've decided to focus the community on the more accessible Ranked Duels and remove Ranked Dominion temporarily, which was very hard to play based on its low population. As requested by the community, we're adding Ranked Duel out of tournaments with Tournaments being only triggered through rotations. This frequency will be updated based on community feedback.\nStarting on Season 7, players can still participate in Community Orders after they are completed, as long as the order is still available.\nFor example, Tribute Warrior Event is live on Friday until Sunday. The order is completed Saturday morning. Players that play on Saturday afternoon until Sunday can still contribute towards the goal.\nRewards will be distributed to all participant players at the end time of the order (Sunday) and not on the completion time (Saturday morning).\nNote: This doesn't affect Faction Rush \u2013 since participating after the event is over might change the results of the Rush, for this specific order type, players still need to participate in the event before it is completed.\nDeveloper comments: The order participation was something brought up many times by the community. We want to reward players based on their engagement with the game and it was hard for us when we heard that players were frustrated because they were not able to participate because of the unpredictable nature of estimates. We hope to address this with the participation change.\nMax reputation level increased from 50 to 60. Each reputation level come with an outfit as rewards. As an ultimate reward, you get an exclusive Effect at Rep 60!\nDeveloper Comments: With more people reaching the max reputation, we introduced more levels to bring a new objective to high-level players.\n2 New Weapons visual for all heroes! One for each Hero will only appear in the Change Look once you loot it.\nChanged the health upon being revive to 50% (down from 100%), applicable in all game modes.\nLadder Punch Strike is now 400ms (was 600ms), and can now hit opponents between 100ms and 400ms (was 500ms-600ms).\nLadder Punch Recovery is now 400ms (was 500ms).\nLadder Slide hit area slightly reduced.\nDeveloper comments: We do not want to see a lot of combat on ladders \u2013 but the combat we do see has been biased in favor of the opponent who is above. Now, this will even out a bit.\nSliding down on a player or attacking a player sharing a ladder does not deal damage anymore. It only knocks the opponent off.\nAdded a timer in the Matchmaking screen to show the actual time passed searching for a match.\nA 10 seconds warning message will be displayed before being removed from a match due to inactivity.\nDeveloper comment: Due to community request, the Quickchat can now be disabled or set to Team only. This new setting only effects the received messages and the default setting is All as before.\n[Bug fix] Stance Change now properly updates stance when hit for the Conqueror and the Aramusha.\n[Bug fix] Orochi, Peacekeeper, Conqueror, Lawbringer and Highlander (in Offensive form) can no longer perform diagonal back dodges.\n[Bug Fix] Reduced Deflects left movement of the Peacekeeper and the Shaman by 0.25m, to make sure Multi-Deflect connects through all 4 hits of the Berserker's Zone Attack.\n[Bug Fix] Fixed an issue that caused Throws to sometimes cost more stamina then they should.\nReduced the stamina cost to enter Full Block Stance to 10 (from 20).\nReduced the stamina cost of Flail Uppercut to 10 (from 20).\nWhen Blocking an attack from Full Block Stance will cost stamina (just like the Warlord).\nLight Block Reaction \u2013 13 stamina.\nMedium Block Reaction \u2013 25 stamina.\nHeavy Block Reaction \u2013 34 stamina.\nLight Block Reaction \u2013 7 stamina.\nMedium Block Reaction \u2013 12.5 stamina.\nHeavy Block Reaction \u2013 17 stamina.\n[Bug Fix] Fixed an animation issue for the Chained Light Attacks after a Heavy Top Attack.\n[Bug Fix] Fixed an issue that caused Conqueror to play the exit animation of Charge Heavy twice in a row when cancelling the charge.\n[Bug Fix] After a Guard Break, the Raider's attack can now correctly be launched from any stance.\n[Bug Fix] Fixed that caused the Raider's 'Press Backbreaker' to not ledge properly.\n[Bug Fix] Fixed an issue that caused a camera issue when Warlord's 'Head Splitter' was being deflected.\n[Bug Fix] Fixed an issue that allowed Kensei's Right Heavy Finishers (when cancelled from Top Heavy Finisher) to act as a chain starter on Miss.\n[Bug Fix] Fixed an issue where 'Demon Embrace' improperly ignored defenses (such as another Shugoki's Passive Uninterruptible Stance).\n[Bug Fix] Fixed an issue that caused the Nobushi's kick to cost extra stamina when missed.\n[Bug Fix] Fixed an issue that caused the Shinobi to be unable to Counter Guard Break after Heavy Finishers is parried.\n[Improvement] Increased the rotation at the start of the Gladiator's 'Crowd Pleaser' and forward 'Cheap Shot'.\n[Bug Fix] Gladiator's Skewer's 3rd Bleed application is now applied at 1200ms after the Hit (was 1100ms).\nDeveloper comments: This is to prevent the 3rd Bleed being applied and still allowing the branch to Dodge.\nBlock Damage is now doubled.\nPunch Through cannot kill though Block Damage anymore.\nThe Uninterruptible effect on light attacks has been removed.\nBleed effects have been removed.\nDeveloper comments: ' Punch Through' initial setup was causing issues in an increasing number of edge cases. We decided to re-tool it from the ground up to make it future-proof and more consistent with the basic fighting mechanics.\n[Bug Fix] Potentially fixed an issue that caused the Emblem to reset, as we were never able to reproduce this issue internally we hope that this will fix the issue.\n[Bug Fix] Fixed an issue that caused the Default controller layout to show feat 3 and feat 4 as inversed.\n[Bug Fix] Fixed an issue that caused the player to not be redirected to the Main Menu if \u2018Back' button is clicked on the \u2018Preview Bundle' page.\n[Bug Fix] Fixed an issue that caused forfeit to not be displayed when a player leaves a game mode that has forfeiting enabled.\nThe 'Spiked Banner' paint pattern that is awarded with Reputation 18 and Reputation 22 outfits. This will now unlock at Reputation 18 Outfit only, a new Paint pattern will replace it for the Reputation 22 outfit.\nThe 'Thundermoon' symbol that is awarded with Reputation 4 and Reputation 16 outfits. This will now unlock at Reputation 4 Outfit only, a new symbol will replace it for the Reputation 16 outfit.\nThe 'Iron Grip' symbol that is awarded with Reputation 18 and Reputation 22 outfits. This will now unlock at Reputation 18 Outfit only, a new symbol will replace it for the Reputation 22 outfit.\nFor Honor update 1.26 increased the range of the Side Dodge Attacks to 2 meters (was 1.25 meters).\nFor Honor 1.26 fixed issue that caused the Peacekeeper, Aramusha and Shugoki's Guardbreak to be harder then expected to counter.\nFor Honor version 1.26 fixed an issue that caused the level 2 and 3 bot to not be aware that they could be killed by chip damage.\nFor Honor 1.26 fixed an issue that caused the axe of the raider to become offset during the 'Pure Force' execution.\n[Bug Fix] For Honor version 1.26 fixed an issue that allowed the Nobushi to perform 'Swift Recoil' by pressing the Dodge button after a counter-guardbreak. The Nobushi can now only perform Swift Recoil only after blocking.\n[Bug Fix] For Honor update 1.26 addressed an issue that caused the Shinobi to become 'Unbalanced' after being parried even if his opponent is interrupted and does not perform the parry.\n[Bug Fix] For Honor patch 1.26 addressed a cosmetic issue that caused the Highlander's Top Attack to play an incorrect animation when Interrupt Blocked.\nFor Honor patch 1.26 fixed an issue that caused the Peacekeeper bot to unlock and roll away after long range throws.\nFor Honor version 1.26 fixed an issue that caused the clickable area to change game mode in any playlist to be offset.\nFor Honor 1.26 update fixed an issue that caused the description text for A or Square in the 'Button Layout 1' to be cut off and overlapping with the text above it in some languages.\nCheck your game update and download the latest For Honor update 1.26.", "timestamp": "2019-04-25T22:32:49Z", "url": "http://updatecrazy.com/for-honor-update-1-26-patch-notes-for-ps4-and-xbox-one/"}

{"text": "BREXIT will be good for Brighton and Hove, Theresa May has told The Argus.\nThe Prime Minister has called on the country and the Remain-voting city to leave behind the divisions of last summer's referendum and 'enthusiastically embrace the opportunities' created by leaving the European Union.\nAnd the Conservative leader said only by getting the best Brexit deal can she ensure the city's under- pressure council, police force, schools and NHS would receive sufficient funding.\nShe also dismissed suggestions from across the Channel that the UK could be hit with a \u20ac100 billion bill for leaving the EU in two years' time.\nMrs May visited The Argus offices in Manchester Street, Brighton, yesterday afternoon during a whistle-stop tour of three Sussex marginal seats in what she dubbed the country's 'most important election' in her lifetime.\nThe PM said she had 'absolute confidence' in Brighton Kemptown candidate Simon Kirby as a strong advocate for Brexit as he defends his slim majority of 690.\nThe former pub owner was stripped of his Brexit responsibilities protecting financial services in January after misgivings from City bosses to be replaced by his Treasury junior Baroness Lucy Neville-Rolfe. Mr Kirby has been dubbed the invisible MP by election rivals.\nThe Prime Minister said Mr Kirby was still playing a Treasury role in Brexit negotiations.\nIn a wide-ranging interview she also made no assurances the Government would step in to end the Southern Rail dispute if she was returned to Downing Street but said she hoped the two sides would get around the table. She also insisted that direct driver-operated trains were safe and had been operating safely in England for more than 30 years.\nShe admitted her party had made administrative errors at the last election but would 'continue to operate' within the campaign spending rules.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has still to decide whether to bring election fraud charges against up to 30 MPs, officials and election agents.\nSussex Police investigated two claims of election expenses irregularities for Lewes candidates but ruled there was insufficient evidence to proceed while separate allegations were not proceeded with after prosecution time limits had expired.\nEarlier in the day, the Prime Minister visited her home town of Eastbourne, where she lived until the age of three, to meet supporters before heading out to knock on doors.\nShe also paid a visit to Lewes candidate Maria Caulfield who was campaigning in Seaford.\nMs Caulfield said: 'Only Theresa May can provide the strong and stable leadership that this country needs and a vote for me locally will help to ensure that Theresa May is returned to Downing Street.\n'A vote for anyone else will bring a coalition of chaos with Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister.\n'Everyone said he couldn't win the Labour leadership at 200-1, but he did.\nIT started with a six-year-old cocker spaniel searching The Argus toilets for explosives.\nFive hours later a silver Jaguar XJ, flanked by two Land Rovers, rolled down Manchester Street, Brighton.\nThe doors opened in unison and half a dozen burly men jumped out, clutching their earpieces.\nSeconds later the Prime Minister emerged.\nDressed in a fitted stone-coloured jacket and brown trousers (impossible to say if they were worth \u00a31,000), she skipped up the stairs and into The Argus boardroom to meet the editor.\nThere was no handbag but a statement necklace gave her outfit a bit of colour. The dozen or so red beads resembled giant gobstoppers.\nAnd, of course, she was wearing her trademark leopard print shoes.\nAfter a grilling from our local government reporter she was given a tour of the newsroom, shadowed by her two advisers.\n'It's good to be back in Sussex,' the Eastbourne-born 60-year-old told one of our reporters.\nLike a particularly un-athletic FA Cup final line up, the editor walked her down the office, introducing her to staff as he went.\nSome asked questions, others waited to be spoken to.\nShe may be the most powerful woman in the country but that didn't faze Elsa Gillio, who heads up The Argus Appeal charity. After telling the Prime Minister of all the good work the charity does, our Elsa asked for the shoes off her feet for an auction.\nThere were a few nervous moments, the PM not entirely sure if Elsa was serious (she was). But she eventually declined.\nNext she visited our sports desk and told our team of her love of cricket and athletics.\nAlbion reporter Andy Naylor informed her that Margaret Thatcher was elected in 1979, just 48 hours before Brighton reached the top flight. Perhaps an omen for June 8, he suggested? But Ms May was more keen to discuss cricket, telling him she once had a season ticket at Surrey.\nWith that it was time for her leave and the Jaguar was fired up.\n'How are you getting back to London tonight Prime Minister?' asked one reporter. 'The train,' she responded.\nA collective 'oooo' rang around the newsroom as she forced a smile.\nOur leaders are often accused of living a privileged existence. But last night she perhaps got a taste of the real world, courtesy of Southern Rail.", "timestamp": "2019-04-26T08:14:43Z", "url": "https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/15266965.prime-minister-brexit-will-be-good-for-brighton-and-hove/"}
